## Subependymal Gray Matter Heterotopia as a cause of Epilepsy
- "Candle guttering" was a term used in old textbooks to refer to the morphology of subependymal heterotopic gray matter. 
- Appears as small nodules of gray matter underneath the ependymal surface, around the ventricle
- ![[Pasted image 20250806084228.png \| 250]]
- Heterotopic gray matter is highly epileptogenic
- More common in **females**, there is some **X-linked** component
- More frequently seen in [[Tuberous Sclerosis Complex\|Tuberous Sclerosis Complex]]
- Example of a woman with severe convulsive seizures, which significantly increases risk for SUDEP
	- Evaluated with SEEG to attempt to map the focus of the seizures, demonstrated no focal lesions in the temporal lobes
	- RNS device, 2 electrodes a depth and a surface or any mix of the two, although deep occipital subependymal nodules
		- Note that for bitemporal epilepsy, you will place 2 depth electrodes because you need control of both foci
	- Then she developed drop attacks, these seizures stop very well with corpus callosotomy

## Raney Clips during Closure
Remove 1 pair of raney clips at a time
the rule is 1 raney clip = 1 galeal suture
Closure of the galea is in itself hemostatic
If anything is actively pumping you can use the bipolar, but oozing is good for wound healing

## Neurogenic Claudication
Pain in the legs, worsened by exertion
Leaning forward when walking uphill, is the shopping cart sign

> Anterolisthesis vs. Spondylolisthesis vs. Spondylosis
> spondylosis implies that there is Narrowing of the spinal canal

## Treatment options
Fusion WITHOUT decompression - indicated for patients with Dynamic myelopathy only
Anterior Corpectomy - indicated for the patient with a kyphotic deformity
The rate of kyphotic deformity from laminoplasty, which maintains the posterior tension band, is 8% when compared to 45% with laminectomy
## Anterior corpectomy steps
>80% of the risk is the exposure, if this person has a really fat neck, the anterior approach will be very complicated and you should go with the suboptimal approach
Patient factors will make you choose the safer approach for the patient. Esophageal injuries are more common when ENT does the exposure in personal experience

ACDF exposure, anterior to SCM, retract carotid and longissimus laterally
in the plane between the carotid sheath lateral and 
conventional discektomy at all levels
