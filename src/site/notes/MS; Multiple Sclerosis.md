> Multiple sclerosis (MS), the most prevalent immune-mediated demyelinating disease, typically presents with episodic neurologic dysfunction. According to the McDonald criteria for MS diagnosis, patients must have evidence of demyelinating lesions that are separated in time and location. This evidence is typically based on subjective symptoms and radiologic studies. This patient's lower extremity weakness (likely secondary to corticospinal tract pathology), bilateral upper extremity paresthesia (secondary to involvement of sensory tracts), and vision loss and pain (secondary to optic neuritis) are separated in space and time.  MRI typically shows white matter hyperintensities in the periventricular region, cortex, subcortical region, cerebellum, or spine. Oligoclonal bands of immunoglobulins, indicating immune overactivation, can be found in the cerebrospinal fluid but are not necessary for diagnosis.

## Associations
monocular blindness due to [[optic neuritis\|optic neuritis]]
	Optic neuritis is a classic manifestation of MS and is characterized by a central scotoma, afferent pupillary defect, and pale optic disc on examination (which may resolve after the acute episode).
[[Lhermitte sign \|Lhermitte sign ]]refers to a transient sensation of electric shock triggered by neck flexion, which is a common sign in MS hypothesized to result from spinal cord inflammation.

## Treatment
Treatment includes corticosteroids for symptomatic management of acute flares and long-term disease-modifying treatments such as **interferon beta therapy** or monoclonal antibodies.
	The interferons downregulate immune activity and thereby decrease disease severity and relapse frequency.
