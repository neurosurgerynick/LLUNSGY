A subdural hygroma develops at the site of lowest pressure in the cranial cavity and begins by separating the dura-arachnoid junction. In patients with severe baseline atrophy, hygromas develop passively through an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid. The development of a hygroma, much like a hematoma, induces the formation of neo-membranes accompanied by neovascularization, and these fragile vessels promote repeated microhemorrhage and eventual development of cSDH
