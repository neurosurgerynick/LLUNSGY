## Primary Dystonia (inherited)
DYT1 autosomal dominant dystonia: 80% response rate to globus pallidus dystonia, remarkable DBS response, near cure
Autosomal recessive, X linked recessive, mitochondrial

## Secondary Dystonia (acquired)
Toxic
Kernicterus (hyperbilirubinemia)
Vascular neonatal infarcts
Brain injury
Idiopathic

All of these varying injuries cause the **exact same phenotype** which lends insight into how the motor pathway works
