## Pathophysiology of Normal ADH secretion
Vasopressin is released from the **posterior pituitary** the other hormone that is released from the posterior pituitary is **oxytocin**
ADH acts to increase the permeability of the renal collecting duct (V2 receptors) to H2O to increase fluid status
	In the [[Hyponatremia Algorithm\|Hyponatremia Algorithm]] it is a real hyponatremia (Sosm < 275 mOsm/kg) that is not caused by the patient Uosm > 100 mOsm/kg

## Symptoms
Mild to moderate symptoms include: anorexia, headache, difficulty concentrating, irritability, [[dysgeusia\|dysgeusia]], muscle weakness
Severe symptoms: coma, delirium, seizures (indicates necessary severe treatment protocol, see below:)
## Causes
fluoxetine, carbamazepine, cyclophosphamide
[[Bronchogenic Lung cancer; Small cell (SCLC)\|Bronchogenic Lung cancer; Small cell (SCLC)]] is one common cause of SIADH
## Diagnosis
> Suspected SIADH
> 	BMP (high potassium excludes SIADH as a diagnosis) Na < 135
> 	Calculate the Sosm; <275 mOsm/kg
> 	Urine osmolality > 100 mOsm/kg
> 	Exclude hypothyroidism: TSH, FT4
> 	+/- PCWP, Nuc Med Plasma Volume study

In general, 3 diagnostic criteria are: 
**Hyponatremia
Inappropriately concentrated urine - Uosm >100
No evidence of renal or adrenal dysfunction**
	1. low serum sodium (hyponatremia): usually < 134 mEq/L
	2. low effective serum osmolality from increased ADH free water: < 275 mOsm/kg
	3. high urinary sodium (salt wasting): at least > 18 mEq/L, often 50–150. Note: there has not been
	an adequate explanation of the high urinary sodium in SIADH
	4. high ratio of urine:serum osmolality: often 1.5–2.5:1, but may be 1:1
	5. normal renal function (check BUN & creatinine): BUN commonly < 10
	6. normal adrenal function (***no hypotension, no hyperkalemia*** which are also causes of elevated ADH)
	7. Absence of [[Hypothyroidism\|Hypothyroidism]]
	8. No signs of dehydration or overhydration (in many patients with acute brain disease, there is **significant hypovolemia often due to [[CSW; Cerebral salt wasting\|CSW; Cerebral salt wasting]]** and as this is a stimulus for ADH secretion, the ADH release may be “appropriate”

To differentiate SIADH from [[CSW; Cerebral salt wasting\|CSW; Cerebral salt wasting]] (both are hyponatremic)
	Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure (PWCP) and Central Venous Pressure (CVP) is low in CSW
	Nuclear medicine Plasma Volume study is low in CSW
## Treatment
Management is based on the severity and duration of hyponatremia, and the presence of symptoms

> **Acute (<48 hr) Severe Hyponatremia** (<125) OR **Severely symptomatic** 
	Admit to ICU 
	3% hypertonic saline IV at 1-2 mg/kg bodyweight/hr (rate of 2 preferred if coma/seizures)
	Furosemide 20 mg [[Loop diuretics\|Loop diuretics]] qd prevents volume overload
	Labs: serum sodium q2hr, Urinalysis q2hr
	Replete measured urinary K PRN (as increased Na will cause urinary dumping of potassium)
		Thus for a standard 100 kg male, start 3% HTS at 100 ml/hr
	
> **Chronic/Subacute (>48 hr) Severe Hyponatremia** (<125) OR Asymptomatic
	IV NS at 100 mEq/hr
	Furosemide 20 mg qd

> Non-severe SIADH
> 	Fluid restriction < 500 mL/day
### Sodium correction
Avoidance of rapid sodium correction is necessary to avoid **osmostic demyelination syndrome** which is a cause of **central pontine myelinolysis** with other causes being hypoxia/anoxia.
Most common in those with chronic malnourishment or chronic alcoholism
Features: 
	**flaccid quadriplegia**
	mental status changes
	[[Pseudobulbar palsy\|Pseudobulbar palsy]] of the lower cranial nerves 9-12
	
Do not exceed 1 mEq/L/hr for Na repletion
Do not exceed 8 mEq/L/day for Na repletion
Two caveats:
1. ✖ be sure that hyponatremia is not due to CSW (p. 122) before restricting fluids
2. avoid too rapid correction and avoid correcting to normal or supranormal (overcorrection)
sodium to reduce the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome

### Fluid Restriction Recommendations
