## Under normal circumstances,

## Symptoms
mild to moderate symptoms include: anorexia, headache, difficulty concentrating, irritability, [[dysgeusia\|dysgeusia]], muscle weakness
## Diagnosis
In general, 3 diagnostic criteria are: **hyponatremia, inappropriately concentrated urine, and no evidence**
**of renal or adrenal dysfunction**. 
	1. low serum sodium (hyponatremia): usually < 134 mEq/L
	2. low effective serum osmolality: < 275 mOsm/kg
	3. high urinary sodium (salt wasting): at least > 18 mEq/L, often 50–150. Note: there has not been
	an adequate explanation of the high urinary sodium in SIADH
	4. high ratio of urine:serum osmolality: often 1.5–2.5:1, but may be 1:1
	5. normal renal function (check BUN & creatinine): BUN commonly < 10
	6. normal adrenal function (***no hypotension, no hyperkalemia***)
	7. no hypothyroidism
	8. no signs of dehydration or overhydration (in many patients with acute brain disease, there is **significant hypovolemia often due to [[CSW; Cerebral salt wasting\|CSW; Cerebral salt wasting]]** and as this is a stimulus for ADH secretion, the ADH release may be “appropriate”
	9. In uncertain cases, the[[ normal saline infusion test \| normal saline infusion test ]]may be used.

## Treatment
Management is based on the severity and duration of hyponatremia, and the presence of symptoms.
Two caveats:
1. ✖ be sure that hyponatremia is not due to CSW (p. 122) before restricting fluids
2. avoid too rapid correction and avoid correcting to normal or supranormal (overcorrection)
sodium to reduce the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome

### Fluid Restriction Recommendations
