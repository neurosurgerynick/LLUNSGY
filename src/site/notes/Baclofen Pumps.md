**Intrathecal Baclofen**
Treatment of spasticity: 
	Medications can reduce spasticity but they are not helpful for the weakness and incoordination that go along with it. 
**Baclofen** is a medication that binds to and stimulates **GABA-B receptors** predominantly in the spinal cord, thus reducing monosynaptic and polysynaptic excitatory transmission. Baclofen can be taken orally but is also available via intrathecal pump.
	Baclofen Withdrawal: symptoms of sympathetic overdrive (clonus, tachycardia, seizures) you must be put on high-dose baclofen
	Baclofen Overdose: flaccidity, somnolence, bradycardia
**Benzodiazepines** such as diazepam also reduce spasticity but, these are sedating medications and are generally not recommended.
**Botulinum toxin injections** into spastic muscles can also be helpful and last 3 months.
