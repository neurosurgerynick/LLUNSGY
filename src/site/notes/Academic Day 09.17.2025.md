## Presurgical Conference

63 year old female presenting with sudden onset generalized weakness, hx of stroke in 2024, hx of possible seizure activity, in status epilepticus (managed by neurology) comes to clinic. 

Imaging: Hyperacute CTA head performed, CT perfusion
CT perfusion
	rCBF<30%: 13cc in the right frontal area; on DWI this would be bright (reflecting core infarct)
	Tmax>6s: 294cc involving bilateral hemispheres (reflecting threatened territory)
		Note that patients can go for years with "threatened" territory
see [[Stroke/acute ischemic stroke\|acute ischemic stroke]]
CTA
	stenotic bilateral ICAs
	Right sided ventriculomegaly related to previous hydrocephalus ex-vacuo from encephalomalacia
	fragile "puff of smoke" vessels near the Left MCA [[moya moya disease\|moya moya disease]]
[[Superficial Temporal Artery; STA\|Superficial Temporal Artery; STA]] collaterals

Surgical operation: IDAS; no competetive flow as in direct bypass, in this case you must be careful with the [[T2DM\|T2DM]] hemoglobin A1c, and you must be careful about doing bilateral procedures as dual STA bypass can cause ischemia to the scalp even in healthy young patients.

Young woman with a CP angle tumor, T1WI + contrast showing enhancing well-circumscribed round lesion with central necrosis and encasement of the vertebral artery and basilar artery causing compression on the pons and the midbrain. 
Options for approaches:
	1. Retrosigmoid craniotomy: hearing is preserved
	2. Presigmoid with mastoidectomy translabrynthine

Remember that Far Lateral is not a good option in this case because that is used for foramen magnum lesions. 

Retrolabyrinthine approach

39yo female with Carotid MRI APS shwoing a right sided isodense lesion with displacement of the great vessels of the neck

Differential Diagnosis:
	Soft tissue carcinoma
	[[Paraganglioma\|Paraganglioma]]
	Schwannoma of glossopharyngeal nerve, phrenic nerve, cervical spinal roots
If very High:
	[[Glomus jugulare tumor\|Glomus jugulare tumor]]: has been misdiagnosed as an AVF because they are highly vascular
Workup:
	If possible, a pre-operative embolization can be used
	Sometimes, a balloon-assisted occlusion of the vessel 

# Milestone Didactic
## Cerebral Palsy and Functional Neurosurgery in Pediatrics
Movement disorders:
Passive
	Spasticity: stretch dependent spinal reflexes
	Rigidity
Active
	[[Dystonia\|Dystonia]]: sustained, twisting
	Chorea: sudden, jerky

Modified Ashworth Scale

[[Selective Ventral Rhizotomy\|Selective Ventral Rhizotomy]] - only used for patients who are GMFCS V without motor control, but such spasticity that it is difficult for the caretaker to do transfers etc.
