## Physical Examination
- delayed relaxation phase of DTRs
- dry skin
## Workup
TSH is the standard measurement to determine if the patient has hypothyroidism
Free T4  is collected in certain situations:
	1. FT4 is used to monitor levothyroxine requirements for central (pituitary) hypothyroidism, low TSH due to pituitary disorder
	2. To differentiate between clinical hypothyroidism (high TSH, low FT4) and subclinical hypothyroidism (high TSH, normal FT4)
		1.  Clinical hypothyroid (low T4) is **primary hypothyroidism** indicating thyroid gland dysfunction
		2. (Normal FT4, usually suggesting [[Hashimoto Thyroditis; Chronic Lymphocytic Thyroiditis\|Hashimoto Thyroditis; Chronic Lymphocytic Thyroiditis]] if in conjunction with a positive TPO antibody)
	3. High FT4 and High TSH indicates TSH secreting tumor -> thus referral to endocrinology is warranted

## Dyslipidemia
reduced hepatic LDL-R expression -> increased LDL, increased total cholesterol [[hypercholesterolemia\|hypercholesterolemia]]
reduced lipoprotein lipase -> incresed triglycerides

## TSH needs to be checked prior to starting [[Statin Therapy\|Statin Therapy]] to reducethe  risk of statin myopathy


## Treatment
Levothyroxine alone; do not use triiodothyronine for any reason based on level A evidence
	Take 30 minutes before eating, and 4 hours before use of any GI drugs:

	Old patients especially with heart disease need more thyroid to start out:

For hypothyroid patients who become pregnant:
	Increase weekly doses from 7 to 9
	increase levothyroxine dose by 30%
	Measure serum TSH every 4 weeks
For patients with subclinical hypothyroisism:
	Do not prescribe levothyroxine unless the TSH >10 or Thyroid peroxidase antibody is elevated
Do not use US unless there is a palpable [[Thyroid Nodules\|Thyroid Nodules]]
