Most common causes of IPH in children
	1. AVM: spontaneous bleed, tracks into the ventricle
	2. AVM
	3. AVM
	4. Trauma: non spontaneous
	5. Coagulopathy
You can differentiate trauma from IPH with fall by looking at the CTA, oftentimes the AVM does not rupture concentrically, so you look at the edges of the hemorrhage for the nidus. Feeding arteries, look dilated and do not taper as with a normal M3 or M4 vessel. 

## corridors to the occipital lobe
- Occipital transcortical: problem is that you will disturb the optic radiations
- Interhemispheric: **Distal PCA branches lie in the subarachnoid space**, you will more readily view the feeding vessels if you take this approach. If the hematoma presents to the cortical surface along the interhemispheric fissure, you can minimize the amount of cortical injury using this approach. Brain relaxation is important, if you wait a 1-2 months before resection, the gliosis that occurs 2/2 hemorrhage will help. Lateral positioning helps (ipsilateral side down) because it holds the contralateral hemisphere up and out of the way, while gravity pulls the ipsilateral hemisphere down so you can view inside.

## Corridors to the third ventricle
If taking out a sega you would go interhemispheric transcallosal

You still want your lesional side down so that the falx is able to retract for you 
### Superior anastomotic vein of Trolard
- watch out for flow voids, because in AVM cases there is venous shunting, increased size of veins and increased pressure,  increased emissary veins through the bone and you will get bone bleeding. 

## Thoracic Disc Herniation
Look at STIR for fat suppression, get rid of the fat so any STIR hyperintensity shows edema
Less than 1 in 1 million of all disc herniations
DO NOT DO A POSTERIOR LAMINECTOMY! because the spinal cord is big and the canal is small, the spinal cord hugs the ventral surface even though CSF flow can be present posteriorly. The thoracic spinal cord is under tension and hugs the ventral surface, if you do a laminectomy in the thoracic region for this, you are spinning your wheels
### Treatment
Neurologically asymptomatic (w/ pain only) with large TDH and cord deformity: you can manage conservatively, safe to watch, the thoracic spine doesn't move that much, 77% return to work without any surgery
	Rest
	NSAIDs
	Steroid injections
Myelopathic/Intractable axial pain or radicular pain/Progressive LE weakness: surgery
A. IF Posterior disc herniation: only for cervical or lumbar -> laminectomy
B. IF lateral disc herniation: transpedicular
C. IF medial disc herniation: costotransversectomy
E. IF anterior disc herniation: lateral
