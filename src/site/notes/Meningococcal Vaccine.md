# **Meningococcal Vaccine**

##### **Summary of Recommendations**

- Administer two doses of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine at least 8 weeks apart to all people with HIV age ≥18 years **(AII).**
- For people with HIV receiving primary vaccination, administer two doses at least 8 weeks apart.
- For individuals with HIV who have been vaccinated previously and are age ≥7 years, repeat vaccination every 5 years throughout life **(BIII).**
- At this time, serogroup B meningococcal vaccination (MenB) is not routinely indicated for adults and adolescents with HIV.

##### **Evidence Summary**

Meningococcal meningitis, caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_, is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis among children and young adults in the United States. Surveillance data collected from 1998 to 2007 identified 2,262 cases of meningococcal disease from a sample of 13% of the U.S. population from several states. All available formulations of meningococcal vaccine are inactivated. Two quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY) vaccines are currently licensed and available in the United States: (1) Meningococcal groups A, C, W, and Y oligosaccharide diphtheria CRM197 conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-CRM, Menveo); and (2) Meningococcal groups A, C, W, and Y polysaccharide tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT, MenQuadfi). Meningococcal groups ACWY polysaccharide diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-D, Menactra) is no longer available. Quadrivalent meningococcal vaccination is recommended for all adolescents aged 11 to 18 years and people aged 2 to 55 years who are at increased risk for disease.

A growing body of evidence supports an increased risk of meningococcal disease in people with HIV. Studies have shown a 5- to 24-fold increased risk of meningococcal disease in people with HIV compared with people without HIV; low CD4 count and high HIV viral load are associated with increased risk.51 The average annual incidence rate of invasive meningococcal disease was 0.39 cases per 100,000 people. People with HIV with a lower CD4 count are at higher risk of invasive disease.52 In addition, a cohort study found that uptake of the MenACWY vaccine among people with a new diagnosis of HIV infection was low, and time to receipt of first vaccination was long.53

The safety and immunogenicity of MenACWY-D vaccine have been evaluated only in people with HIV aged 11 to 24 years. Patients with CD4% ≥15% received either one or two doses (at 0 and 24 weeks) of vaccine, and those with CD4% <15% received two doses (at 0 and 24 weeks). Among people with HIV who received one dose of vaccine, 21% to 63% developed an antibody titer of ≥1:128 at 72 weeks after vaccination. Antibody responses at 72 weeks in individuals with CD4% <15% were less robust,54 with only 6% to 28% achieving titers ≥1:128. Local site reactions—such as pain and tenderness at injection site—were uncommon (3.1%), as were grade 3 or greater events (2.2%). No vaccine-related deaths or cases of meningitis were noted. No safety or immunogenicity studies are available for MenACWY-CRM in people with HIV, and clinical outcome data for both vaccines in people with HIV are lacking as well.

Menveo and MenQuadfi are recommended for all adults with HIV, regardless of age.

At this time, MenB is not routinely indicated for adults and adolescents with HIV. MenB vaccine may be administered to adolescents and young adults with HIV aged 16 to 23 years (preferred range, ages 16–18 years) for short-term protection against most strains of serogroup B meningococcal disease and for patients at increased risk (e.g., those living in dormitories or barracks) and during outbreaks. Those with functional or anatomic asplenia should also be vaccinated. Two MenB vaccines are available: MenB-4C (Bexsero; two-dose series given at 0 and 1 month) and MenB-FHbp (Trumenba; people with HIV should receive the three-dose series given at 0, 1–2, and 6 months, rather than the two-dose option). MenB vaccines are not interchangeable; the same product must be used for all doses in the series.

Urban outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis have been reported among men who have sex with men in the United States, in men both with and without HIV. Several outbreaks were associated with clubs and bathhouses. Some public health jurisdictions now recommend meningococcal vaccine for all men who have sex with men, regardless of HIV status; however, ACIP has not adopted this recommendation for men who have sex with men without HIV.55
