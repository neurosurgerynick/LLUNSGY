## workup
FDG PET CT, interictal, looking for hypometabolism
T1 coronal MRI: look at the mesial temporal structures
	look for symmetry of temporal horns of the lateral ventricles
	look for atrophy of the mesial structures, mesial temporal sclerosis (side with bigger temporal horn, like hydrocephalus ex vacuo)
Hypometabolism on PET is considered **PET lesional**
Medically intractable? - failure of 2 seizures medications
Surgical options:
	Corticoamygdalohippocampectomy
	Corticoamygdalectomy - want to preserve mesial structures in the dominant hemisphere
	Selective amygdalohippocampectomy - more targeted
	Anterior temporal lobectomy - small trauma incision, reverse question mark, stay underneath the superior temporal line (STL) exposing the inferior frontal gyrus, the zygoma is the base of the skull, burr hole above the root of the zygoma, you need to find the cup of the root of the zygoma and bovie the temporalis if its in your way, the medial portion is the *tentorial incisura*

Positioning: turn the head to 45 degrees, with a bump under the shoulder, some lateral tilting of the head to level out the temporal lobe



Foville's Circonvolution d'enceinte 
	continuous ribbon of brain, surrounding the sylvian fissure
	Involves F3, the supramarginal gyrus, T1

T3 is continuous with O3
T2 is continuous with O2
O1 is continuous with P1
inferior to the intraparietal sulcus is all eloquent
Superior to the intraparietal sulcus is not eloquent - you can remove it
P1 is above the intraparietal sulcus, P2 is below the intraparietal sulcus
![Pasted image 20250716102411.png](/img/user/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250716102411.png)

The supramarginal gyrus is the end of the Sylvian fissure
The angular gyrus is the end of the superior temporal fissure

## Fibers of the brain
U fibers: cortical to cortical connections
Seizures spread by longer white matter fibers, understanding those fibers helps you understand the seimiology of the seizure
Important large fiber bundles: inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferiro occipitofrontal fasciculus, and the uncinate fasciculus, and the superior longtiudinal arcuate fasciculus

## Cytoarchitectonics
Broadmann's central area: 4,3,1,2,5 
[[Corticospinal Tract and Other Motor Pathways\|Corticospinal Tract and Other Motor Pathways]]

## Central Area Seizure patterns
"uncal fits" comes from Jackson who described the "jacksonian march" wherein he found softening of the uncus in patients who were having "dreamy spells" 
Microsubpial transection: scraping every 5mm underneath the pia, disconnecting the U fibers of the brain in order to stop seizure transmission

## Plis de passage
F1, F2 and F3 all have plis des passages with the precentral gyrus, so if you are dissecting a tumor in F1, eventually you are going to hit the precentral gyrus

## Callosal lines
Central area is between the central and post-callosal lines
The SMA is defined in between the anterior and central callosal lines

Foot peddling: common for a frontal lobe epilepsy
## Stimulation parameters
- start stimulating in the sensory areas, once you get that voltage/current you can use that level to stimulate the speech areas to induce speech arrest intraoperatively

# Parietal seizure patterns
dominant parietal lobe epilepsy: speech arrest after a seizure, illusions (distortions of reality: my hand is as big as the hospital)

# occipital lobe epilepsy
The *uncal notch* is considered to be the division between the temporal and the occipital lobes
The line between the sylvian fissure divides the parietal and the occipital lobes
- in occipital lobe epilepsy visual auras are the hallmark
- usually there is some sort of colors or lights in a visual field, upper or lower, right or left visual field, it is contralateral to the seizure focus


# Temporal lobe epilepsy
the most common reason we use SEEG
if bitemporal, you can choose the side that has the worst anatomic abnormality and 50% of patients postoperatively will have seizure freedom because you have disrupted the seizure network
- euphoric auras
- saw someone in a smoky room playing the guitar but not sure who the singer was
- hear music, unsure of what the song is
- saw crocoiles coming out of the floor to eat her, jumped on the table and started screaming
- saw witches from salem coming to get her
## Partial complex seizure aka limbic epilepsy aka mesial temporal lobe epilepsy 
- located in the mesial temporal lobe: hippocampus, dentate, entorrhinal cortext
- Entorrhinal cortex has connections: specifically to the dentate -> hippocampus proper -> fimbria -> fornix
- Ca1, Ca2, Ca3: cornu ammonus God of light with a famous temple in Egypt. 
- loss of consciousness (complex)
- Partial (lack of convulsion)
- automatisms (manual or walking around and doing things), lip smacking
- usually a stare

Dominant temporal lobe, Left sided: verbal memory
Non dominant temporal lobe, right sided: non-verbal memory

*Gelastic seizure* typical of the hypothalamus, mirthless seizure

## Lateral temporal lobe epilepsy
- postictal aphasia is common in the dominant hemisphere
- whoosing sound, helicopter noise, its not a well identified noise like a smoky room guitar

### Insular Lobe epilepsy (extremely rare, you will never see it)
- preserved consciousness
- laryngeal discomfort
- dysphonic or dysarthric speech
- unpleasant sensations or paresthesias

# key takeaways
> if there is a lesion, you should remove the lesion, don't listen to the neurologists pontifications about what the seizure types are


## DBS for Epilepsy
- stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, led by robert fischer at stanford (Neurology)
- FDA approval only for a single target
- open loop
## RNS for Epilepsy
- surface lead and a deep lead
- the surface lead is an EEG, the deep lead has a stimulator that can stop the oncoming seizure within 1 second
- SUDEP: patients with epilepsy are at 7x risk of death compared to patients without epilepsy.
