Note that the most severe is when collaterals and the ICAs disappear, cerebral blood supply is exclusively coming from the [[Superficial Temporal Artery; STA\|Superficial Temporal Artery; STA]] into the brain
## Definition
1. Bilateral stenosis of terminal ICAs
2. Without etiology (idiopathic)

## Hemorrhagic vs. Ischemic presentation
Ischemic presentation more common in children:
	TIA-like symptoms, young, effort-dependent symptoms (numbness when working out), or incidentally found (headaches)
**Hemorrhagic presentation** is more common in adults [[Stroke/Hemorrhagic stroke; ICH; Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage in adults\|Hemorrhagic stroke; ICH; Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage in adults]]
## DDx
[[moya moya syndrome\|moya moya syndrome]]
[[pseudomoyamoya\|pseudomoyamoya]]

## Consequences
Ischemic or Hemorrhagic stroke, the narrowed vessels are fragile
## Management
DAPT
Patients should not stop taking [[aspirin\|aspirin]] for life as it is anti-inflammatory
