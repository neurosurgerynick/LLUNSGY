## Tx
mild to moderate: donepezil or rivastigmine which are [[acetylcholinesterase inhibitors\|acetylcholinesterase inhibitors]] - **contraindicated for patients with sinus bradycardia or heart block**
moderate to severe: **memantine** which is an NMDA receptor antagonist, does change the disease course as it limits glutamate exitotoxicity
## DDx
