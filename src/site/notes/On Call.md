| Step 1: Go to the bedside                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Step 2: Obtain complete set of vital signs including pulse oximetry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Step 3: Consider the differential:<br><br>![[Pasted image 20250225212525.png \| 500]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Step 4: Review the chart<br><br>-  Look for pre-existing diseases such as COPD (think confusion from hypercapnia), dementia, diabetes mellitus (think hypoglycemia) and liver disease (think hepatic encephalopathy)<br>-  Look for sedatives, narcotics, antihistamines and dopamine antagonists (particularly antipsychotics and antiemetics such as metoclopramide), muscle relaxants and antidepressants (particularly tricyclic antidepressants) on the medication list<br>- Look for recent changes in medication dosage (insulin, sedatives/narcotics and anti-hypertensives)<br>- Try and determine last alcohol use (think alcohol withdrawal)<br>- Determine patient’s baseline blood pressure. A lower than normal blood pressure for the patient can lead to cerebral hypoperfusion and altered mental status. |
| Step 5: Obtain a history from patient and staff<br><br>- Rule out fall/head trauma. Describe symptoms and duration.  Are there any associated symptoms that suggest a particular case for the patient’s altered mental status?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Step 6: Physical Exam<br><br>- General appearance including hydration status. Dehydration can lead to confusion, particularly in patients with underlying dementia.<br>- Head/Neck: Look for evidence of head trauma (think concussion or traumatic brain injury) and neck stiffness (think meningo-encephalitis)<br>- Neurological exam: Assess mental status. Look for focal neurological findings (think cerebrovascular accidents), papilledema and asterixis (think hepatic encephalopathy).<br>- Look for focal signs of infection and evidence of chronic liver disease                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Step 7: Laboratory studies<br><br>- Laboratory work-up is guided by history and physical exam<br>- Order head CT if stroke, subdural hematoma or subarachnoid hemorrhage is suspected  <br>- Plan for lumbar puncture if meningo-encephalitis is suspected<br>- Consider CBC, UA/Urine culture, chest x-ray, blood culture and sputum culture, as indicated, if there is suspicion for infection<br>- Consider ABG, BMP, glucose and TSH if a metabolic causes is suspected<br>- Consider EKG, troponin if chest pain and/or hypotension are present<br>- Chest x-ray/ CT chest PE protocol if hypoxia is present, or suspicion for pneumonia/PE is high                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Step 8: Management<br><br>- For agitated patients, three agents may be used. These are **risperidone** (0.5 mg- 1mg orally disintegrating tablets), **quetiapine** (25 mg PO) and **haloperidol** (1-2 mg PO/IM/IV in elderly patients, 2.5-5 mg PO/IM/IV in younger patients. Always check the QTc interval and do not use these medications if QTc is prolonged.

| Potassium levels should be supplemented in patients with hypokalemia. Keep the following points in mind:<br><br>- PO KCl is the preferred approach if the patient can take PO<br>- Potassium chloride should be administered **IV** if the patient is symptomatic (*including presence of EKG changes*), has severe hypokalemia (less than 2.5 meq/L), or cannot take PO<br>- A correction of 0.05 meq/L per 10 mEq of potassium chloride supplemented can be expected. In patients with impaired renal function, expect an increase of 0.1 meq per 10 meq supplementation.<br>- Oral potassium chloride is usually administered as a **40 meq dose with subsequent doses given 4 hours apart**<br>- IV potassium chloride is generally administered as **20 meq doses every 2 hours**<br>- If more than 80 meq supplemental potassium is to be administered, serum potassium should be rechecked to avoid over-correction<br>- The most common issue with oral potassium pills is the size of the pill. The most common patient complaint with the IV formulation is burning with infusion.<br>- **Potassium bicarbonate** is preferred in patients with **concomitant metabolic acidosis** |

| Step 1: Over the phone, inquire about the current heart rate and trend? Find out what the latest blood pressure and other vitals are?  Is the patient symptomatic? Is it sinus bradycardia? Are there any pauses on the telemetry strips (indicating a [[Mobitz Second Degree AV block\|Mobitz Second Degree AV block]])?                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Step 2: **Go to the bedside if patient is symptomatic**, **hypotensive**, or if the trend is concerning (**precipitous drop**). The call may be handled over the phone in non-hypotensive, asymptomatic patients with sinus bradycardia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Step 3: If a trip to the bedside is indicated:<br><br>- Review telemetry, repeat vitals yourself, perform focused assessment and review medications<br>- Obtain 12 lead EKG and interpret rhythm<br>- In a patient with symptomatic bradycardia, Mobitz type 2 second degree heart block, [[Third-degree (complete) AV block\|Third-degree (complete) AV block]] or sinus pause >/= 3 seconds – place external pacing pads on patient and consult CCU for temporary/permanent pacemaker placement |
| Step 4: Whether to withhold medications:<br><br>- Rate lowering meds (e.g. B-blockers, CCBs) may still be given if HR > 60 and pt is asymptomatic<br>- Hold rate lowering meds for HR < 60 and/or symptoms                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

*Chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath etc are all symptoms of end organ hypoperfusion that should be inquired about.

# Constipation on call

Approach to patient

|   |
|---|
|Step 1: Over the phone:<br><br>- Determine that patient is stable and has no other major complaints<br>- Ask about abdominal pain, rectal pain and nausea/vomiting<br>- Screen for signs of fecal impaction, such as no bowel movement for several days, bed-bound status, and passage of liquid stool (overflow incontinence)|
|Step 2: Assess severity:<br><br>- If constipation is isolated and fecal impaction is not suspected, verbal orders suffice<br>- If fecal impaction is suspected or there is abdominal/rectal pain or nausea/vomiting, go to bedside for further w/u|
|Step 3: Management: <br><br>- Perform manual dis-impaction if fecal impaction is present<br>- First line agents:<br>    - Milk of magnesia 30 cc PO<br>    - Bisacodyl (10 mg PO or suppository) or senokot (17.6 mg PO)<br>- 2nd line therapy (if above agents do not work):<br>    - Polyethylene glycol 17 g PO in 8 Oz of water<br>    - Lactulose 30 cc PO<br>- 3rd line (if above agents do not work):<br>    - Tap water or Fleet’s enema|

Helpful hints:

- While using laxatives, keep two things in mind: class and cost. Bisacodyl and Sennakot belong to one class (stimulant agents), while Milk of Magnesia, Magnesium citrate and Polyethylene glycol belong to the other (osmotic agents).  Polyethylene glycol and lactulose are the more expensive of the above agents.
- There is insufficient evidence in the literature supporting the use of sodium docusate for constipation compared to agents mentioned above. Consequently, the use of this agent should be avoided.

| Step 1: Over the phone:<br><br>- Have the nurse obtain a complete set of vital signs<br>- Ask if the source of bleeding is known<br>- Order IV access, CBC (**look for thrombocytopenia**) and coagulation studies (PT/INR, aPTT) and type and cross<br><br>Step 2: Upon arrival at the bedside:<br><br>Determine severity<br><br>- Review vital signs. Blood pressure is particularly important. If the patient is **hypotensive**, establish **2 large bore IVs and initiate a bolus of normal saline.** <br>- Review available trends in CBC/coagulation studies<br>- If active external bleeding is present, staunch bleeding with pressure/bandages where possible<br>- Look for tachycardia and hypotension. As a general rule, absence of tachycardia and hypotension indicates mild bleeding, hypotension indicates severe bleeding and tachycardia or orthostatic hypotension indicates moderate bleeding. <br><br>Determine cause/source<br><br>- Review the chart. Is the patient on any anticoagulants?<br>- Perform brief history and physical<br>    - History: <br>        - Any known coagulopathy?<br>        - If GI bleed is suspected, is there a history of GI bleeding or peptic ulcer disease?<br>        - Is there a H/O hematemesis, melena or bright red blood per rectum?<br>        - Was drop in hemoglobin preceded by severe retching (think Mallory Weiss tear)?<br>        - Is there a H/O cirrhosis? (think variceal bleed)<br>        - Does the patient have gross hematuria? <br>        - Does the patient have abdominal pain? Some patients with **retroperitoneal hematoma present with abdominal pain**.<br>        - Enquire about symptoms of anemia such as shortness of breath, dizziness and chest pain. Be more aggressive in transfusing PRBC (2 units) if symptoms are present.<br>    - Exam: <br>        - Evaluate mental status. Severe anemia can lead to altered mental status.<br>        - Assess hydration status. Hemoglobin can be falsely elevated in patients with hemoconcentration due to dehydration.<br>        - Assess volume status. Severe bleeding can lead to hypovolemia.<br>        - Look for bruises. Excessive bruising is suggestive of coagulopathy. Bruising along the thigh is suggestive of blood loss into an intramuscular hematoma.<br>        - Perform rectal exam. Bright red blood on rectal exam is suggestive of a lower gastrointestinal source of bleeding.<br>        - Look for record of input and output. Aggressive hydration can lead to significantly positive fluid balance which is suggestive of dilutional anemia. <br>        - Perform an abdominal exam. Retroperitoneal hematoma is generally asymptomatic. However, some patients have abdominal tenderness, and some patients present with flank ecchymosis (grey turner sign). <br>- In patients on anticoagulation and no other explanation for dropping hemoglobin, perform CT abdomen to r/o retroperitoneal bleed<br><br>  <br><br>Step 3: Interventions for severe bleeding, defined as bleeding with hemodynamic instability or bleeding into a critical organ or site (intracranial, intraspinal, pericardial, pleural, retroperitoneal, intramuscular with compartment syndrome or ENT with airway compromise):<br><br>- Reverse any coagulopathy:<br>    - Patients on warfarin: Administer 5-10 mg vitamin K IV over 60 minutes with Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (PCC, Kcentra, 1500 units IV). Do not use PCC if Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) is suspected. Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP, 2 units)) is an alternative to PCC.<br>    - Patients on dabigatran: Administer activated charcoal (contraindicated in GI bleeding) if the last dose of dabigatran was within 2 hours. Administer idarucizumab (5 grams orally, administered as 2 consecutive 2.5 gram doses). Consult nephrology to consider prolonged hemodialysis.<br>    - Patients on rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban: Administer activated charcoal (contraindicated in GI bleeding) if the last dose of anticoagulant was within 2 hours. Repeat activated charcoal in 6 hours from the last known dose of anticoagulant. Consider andexanet alfa if last known dose of anticoagulant was within 18 hours (or unknown timeframe) AND if the following criteria are met: anticipated survival greater than 1 month, no plans for emergent surgery in 12 hours (except evacuation of life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage), patient without sepsis, acute thrombosis or pregnancy in the previous 2 weeks, and patient has not received warfarin, dabigatran or PCC within 7 days. Consider PCC (contraindicated if HIT is suspected) if patient is not a candidate for andexanet alfa, and recombinant factor VII concentrate (NovoSeven) if patient is not a candidate for PCC.<br>    - Patients on enoxaparin: Administer protamine IV (1 mg/1 mg enoxaparin if enoxaparin was given within 8 hours, 0.5 mg/1 mg enoxaparin if enoxaparin was given 8-12 hours ago, maximum dose 50 mg)<br>    - Patients on infusion of Unfractionated Heparin (UFH): Administer protamine IV (1 mg/100 units of UFH administered in the previous 2 hours, maximum dose 50 mg)<br>- Consider transfusion for actively bleeding patients:<br>    - Transfuse to keep hemoglobin at baseline or >10 in cardiac patients (whichever is lower)<br>    - Transfuse to keep hemoglobin >8 in all other actively bleeding patients<br>    - **1-unit PRBC increases hemoglobin by 1 g/dL**<br>    - Transfuse platelets if platelet count < 50,000 and patient is actively bleeding<br>    - Consider transfusing platelets in an actively bleeding patient irrespective of platelet count if patient is on aspirin or clopidogrel<br>    - In case of massive bleeds, transfuse 1U FFP for every 5 units of PRBC administered<br>- In uremic patients (dysfunctional platelets) with active bleeding, give 0.3 mcg/kg of DDAVP (desmopressin) IV q12 hours X 3<br><br>- Address source<br>    - Endoscopy (diagnostic and therapeutic) for GI source<br>    - Surgery/interventional radiology for internal bleeding<br><br><br>Step 4: Confirm resolution<br><br>- Measure serial hemoglobin (q 6-8 hour) until bleeding and/or hemodynamic instability has resolved, and hemoglobin is stable |

| Step 1: While on the phone:<br><br>- Request nurse to obtain a full set of vitals (including pulse oximetry) and EKG                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Step 2: Upon arrival at bedside:<br>- Make sure Airway, Breathing and Circulation are secure<br>- Provide 2 liters O2 nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation greater than 92%<br>> Obtain H&P<br> - History: Description of pain (quality, location and duration), cardiac risk factors, presence of heartburn, preceding URI symptoms (costochondritis)<br>- Exam: Check blood pressure in both arms and all peripheral pulses (**unequal blood pressure in two arms or loss of peripheral pulses is seen in aortic dissection**), assess jugular venous pressure, auscultate heart/lungs, assess for calf edema/ /tenderness (unilateral leg swelling suggests deep vein thrombosis which can coexist with pulmonary embolism) and assess for reproducibility of chest pain with pressure (costochondritis/musculoskeletal pain)                                                                     |
| Step 3: Search for underlying cause:<br><br>- Obtain **EKG immediately and troponin 3-4 hours after the onset of pain**. Remember it takes 3 hours for troponin to start rising. The negative predictive value of the test for ACS is low if ordered immediately after the onset of chest pain. <br>    - If an alternative diagnosis is not apparent, place orders for **aspirin 325 mg POx1 and sublingual Nitroglycerin (NTG) 0.4 mg q5 min x 3**<br>    - Resolution of chest pain with NTG suggests a cardiac source of chest pain<br>    - Avoid nitrates if patient takes phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (such as sildenafil) or right ventricular involvement is suspected<br>    - Discontinue nitrates immediately if patient becomes hypotensive   <br>    - Further testing includes Chest X-ray (look for pneumothorax, widened mediastinum suggestive of dissection) and CT chest-PE protocol |
| Step 4: Further management is based on H&P findings and laboratory/radiology results                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Helpful hints:

- The main decision that needs to be made on call is determining if the patient has one of the following life-threatening conditions: acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, pneumothorax and PE.
- Chest pain that is fleeting or lasts hours without EKG changes is unlikely to be ischemic
- Radiation of pain to the right arm is as consistent with MI as is radiation of chest pain to the left arm (LR of MI is 4.5 for radiation to right arm, 2.2 for radiation to left arm)
- If a patient has tenderness on palpation of chest wall, always ask if what they are experiencing is actually reproducing the chest-pain they are seeking help for. Patient’s pain should be considered musculoskeletal only if palpation reproduces the same that has been bothering them in the first place.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Step 1: While on the phone:<br><br>- Determine if a patient has Oliguria (urine output of less than 500 cc/day). For on call purposes, **urine output of less than 30 cc/hour should be considered low**.<br>- Request the nurse obtain a complete set of vitals<br>- Request the nurse perform a **bladder scan**. If patient is retaining urine, the problem is post-renal. Order straight catheterization.<br>- Order strict input/output measurement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Step 2: Upon arriving at the bedside:<br><br>- Review vital signs<br>- Review urine output trend and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine measurements (if available)<br>- Review chart and medications. Note recent addition of NSAIDS, ACE-I, IV dye which can worsen kidney function and perform a focused H&P.<br>- Exam: <br>    - What is the patient’s volume status? Are they hypervolemic or hypovolemic?<br>    - What is the patient’s mental status? Low urine output combined with a low blood pressure suggests systemic hypoperfusion which can be seen in patients’ approaching a shock state. <br>    - What is the gross appearance of urine? <br>- Is the patient in shock? Interventions need to be much more aggressive in a patient in shock.                                          |
| Step 3: Laboratory studies<br><br>- Basic metabolic panel- look for BUN, creatinine and electrolyte abnormalities, particularly hyperkalemia<br>- If the patient has Acute Kidney Injury and cause is not clear, order urine creatinine and urea. Use these values to calculate Fractional Excretion of Urea (FEUrea). FEUrea greater than 50% is suggestive of an intrinsic renal cause of AKI, while values less than or equal to 35% suggest a pre-renal cause of AKI.<br>- Urine-analysis can help distinguish intrarenal or pre-renal causes of AKI<br>- Renal ultrasonography should be ordered if a pre-renal cause of AKI is not readily evident. Hydronephrosis suggests postrenal obstruction.                                                                                                     |
| Step 4: Based on the work-up above, localize cause of AKI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Step 5: Provide appropriate treatment based on the cause of AKI. Note that 90% of cases of AKI have a reversible cause.<br><br>- Prerenal, hypovolemic AKI: Administer 500 cc bolus of normal saline. In patients with low ejection fraction, reduce bolus to 250 cc.<br>- Prerenal, hypervolemic AKI: <br>    - In patients with heart failure, administer loop diuretics, such as furosemide 40 IV. Consider higher does in patients already on diuretics.<br>    - In patients with cirrhosis, consider IV albumin, particularly if serum albumin is below 2.5 g/dL<br>- Postrenal AKI: In confirmed postrenal AKI, prompt correction with Foley catheterization should be performed<br>- Intrinsic AKI: Withdraw any offending agents, and consider biopsy for vascular, glomerular, or unknown etiology |
| Step 6: Correct any electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyperkalemia                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Step 7: Follow for resolution:<br><br>- Follow urine output (goal ≥ 30 cc/hour), make sure a BMP is ordered for the primary team to follow up on in the morning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
# Fall-on Call

Approach to patient

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Always interview and examine a patient with a fall at the bedside                                                                                                                                                      |
| Step 1:  Assess vital Signs (**including orthostatics**), telemetry (if available), and ensure Airway-Breathing-Circulation (ABC) are intact                                                                           |
| Step 2: Interview the patient and nurse/staff to determine how the fall occurred. The goal is to distinguish between mechanical and non-mechanical fall.                                                               |
| Step 3: Screen patient for the following:<br><br>- Did you hit your head?<br>- Did you injure yourself?  Are you experiencing any pain post-fall?                                                                      |
| Step 4: Perform complete physical and neurological exam                                                                                                                                                                |
| Step 5: Obtain X-rays of any part of the body that was injured due to the fall                                                                                                                                         |
| Step 6: Indications for Head CT:<br><br>- Head trauma during fall<br>- Neurological deficit(s) or change in mental status (including syncope)<br>- Anticoagulant use or known coagulopathy                             |
| Step 7: Discontinue any medications which may have contributed to the fall (benzodiazepines, narcotics, antihypertensives/antidepressants if orthostatic, oral hypoglycemics if hypoglycemic, diuretics if dehydrated) |
| Step 8: Write orders for “out of bed with assistance only”. If dementia or delirium is suspected, write for bed alarm and/or sitter.                                                                                   |
| Step 9:  File incident report (done by nursing or MD, varies by health system) and document the fall and your response clearly in the medical record                                                                   |
# Cough on call

Approach to the patient

| Step 1: Over the phone:<br><br>- Is the cough new? <br>- Are there associated symptoms such as hemoptysis, shortness of breath, chest pain or hypoxia?<br>- Are vital signs stable?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Step 2: Management according to severity:<br><br>- If cough has been present prior to your shift, not associated with signs and symptoms mentioned above and vitals are stable, symptomatic management on the phone usually suffices<br>- In case symptoms mentioned above are present, patient has a new cough or vitals are unstable, evaluate the patient at bedside and work up as appropriate to find an etiology for the cough                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Step 3: Symptomatic management:<br><br>- There are two general classes of medications used for cough: antitussives (cough centre suppressants) and expectorants (agents that increase bronchial secretion or loosen its viscosity) Expectorants may paradoxically increase cough by increasing secretions. Most commercially available formulations are available as combination products (antitussive plus expectorant).<br>- Examples of antitussives are Dextromethorphan and Codeine. Dextromethorphan is a synthetic compound with similar antitussive efficacy as codeine and virtually devoid of codeine’s constipating and addictive side effects. Guaifenesin is the typical expectorant available in the United States<br>- First line agents:  Dextromethorphan alone, or if unavailable dextromethorphan/Guaifenesin (e.g., Robitussin-DM) syrup, usually 10 cc PO q 6 prn. <br>- Second line: Codeine 10-20 mg PO q 4-6 pr<br>- Albuterol inhaler/nebulizer is a useful agent to treat cough in patients predisposed to bronchospasm (patients with asthma and COPD) |

| Step 1: While on the phone:<br><br>- Request the nurse obtain vital signs (including pulse oximetry)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Step 2: Upon arrival at the bedside:<br><br>- Secure ABC’s.<br>- Review vital signs.<br>- Review input/output and patient’s weight since admission. Determine if the patient is in significant positive fluid balance (pulmonary edema). Volume overload is a common iatrogenic problem, especially in patients with underlying CHF.<br>- Administer oxygen for to maintain oxygen saturation ≥92% (≥88% in known/suspected COPD patients)<br>- Review chart and perform focused H&P<br>    - Ask about the onset of Shortness Of Breath (SOB). Sudden onset SOB in the hospital can be due to Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and acute coronary syndrome, while SOB that develops over hours can be from volume overload, asthma/COPD exacerbation or pneumonia. <br>    - Ask about exacerbating factors. **Orthopnea is suggestive of volume overload**, while **pleuritic chest pain is concerning for PE/pneumonia**.<br>    - Ask about associated symptoms. Chest pain and palpitations suggest acute coronary syndrome, while cough and fever are consistent with pneumonia. <br>    - Consider risk factors for PE, such as recent surgery and immobilization<br>    - Review past history for COPD, CHF (particularly low ejection fraction) and PE (is the patient adequately anticoagulated)?<br>    - Exam: Assess mental status (CO2 retention can lead to somnolence), measure JVP, auscultate heart/lungs for crackles (volume overload and pneumonia) and wheezes (asthma/COPD exacerbation and volume overload), and assess for calf edema (DVT/PE, volume overload) and calf tenderness (DVT/PE) |
| Step 3: Determine if the patient is going to need intubation. Criteria include:<br><br>- Hypoxemia not corrected by oxygen supplementation of 60% FiO2 or higher<br>- pH < 7.20<br>- Clinical signs of severe respiratory distress such as accessory muscle use/cyanosis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Step 4: Laboratory studies to identify underlying cause<br><br>- Obtain EKG (look for ACS, arrhythmias precipitating volume overload), Chest x-ray (look for pulmonary edema and pneumonia), and ABG if the patient is in severe respiratory distress<br>- Consider D-dimer/Chest CT if PE is suspected<br>- Consider echocardiogram if pericardial effusion/tamponade is suspected                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Step 5: Interventions:<br><br>- For suspected/confirmed pulmonary edema secondary to CHF/volume overload, give furosemide 20 mg IV for patients who are not already on diuretics. Higher doses may be necessary for patients on diuretics.<br>- For suspected/confirmed asthma attack/COPD exacerbation, give:<br>    - Albuterol & ipratropium nebs q 2-4 hrs.<br>    - Consider prednisone 40 mg PO<br>    - Consider azithromycin 500 mg PO for COPD exacerbation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

# Hypocalcemia on call

 Approach to patient 

|   |
|---|
|Step 1: Obtain calcium value corrected for serum albumin|
|Step 2: Determine if tetany, arrhythmias or seizures are present. If so, administer calcium gluconate 10 mL (10%) IV over 10 minutes, repeat until response occurs, followed by 10mg/Kg elemental calcium infused as calcium gluconate over 4 hours (each 10 mL vial of 10% calcium gluconate contains 90 mg elemental calcium)|
|Step 3: For asymptomatic hypocalcemia, order calcium carbonate 1-2 gram/day with vitamin D. It is appropriate to defer work-up for cause of hypocalcemia to the primary team.|

Fever on Call

Approach to patient

|   |
|---|
|Step 1: Go to bedside for new onset fever or if the patient spikes a significantly higher fever than they have so far|
|Step 2: Obtain complete set of vitals.  Is hypotension/tachycardia present?  While tachycardia is a normal response to elevated temperature or , hypotension can be suggestive of developing or worsening sepsis. Track temperature trends. If the patient’s temperature is similar to what has already been seen during the hospitalization, assessment at the bedside is usually not required.|
|Step 3: Review the chart.  <br><br>- Review medications. Are there any potential causes of drug fever?<br>- Review past medical history. Is there a history of immunocompromise/neutropenia/chemotherapy? Such patients typically need broader antibiotic coverage and can deteriorate quickly.<br>- Has the patient undergone recent surgery? Atelectasis is a common cause of fever within 24 hours of surgery.|
|Step 4: History and Physical<br><br>- Obtain a focused history.  Are any other symptoms present? Cough is suggestive of pneumonia, while dysuria is concerning for urinary tract infection, particularly in patients who previously had a foley catheter. Abdominal pain can be suggestive of Clostridium difficile colitis, while a headache may point towards sinusitis, particularly if a patient has a NG tube or one was recently removed. Vomiting in a patient with pre-existing stroke or diminished mental status can lead to aspiration pneumonia.<br>- Exam: <br>    - Skin: Examine IV access sites (think line infection/phlebitis).  Look for cellulitis and ulcers, including decubitus ulcers in patients with prolonged hospitalization.<br>    - Neurological: Look for obtundation/photophobia/neck stiffness (think meningitis)<br>    - Pulmonary: Listen for crackles/consolidation (think pneumonia)<br>    - CV: Listen for new murmurs (think endocarditis)<br>    - Abdomen: Listen for Bowel sounds. Clostridium difficile colitis can be associated with ileus. Examine for focal tenderness.<br>    - Extremities: Look for signs of DVT<br>    - ENT: Examine for sinus tenderness (think sinusitis, especially in patients with current/recent NG tubes)|
|Step 5: Laboratory studies<br><br>- Lab work-up is guided by history and physical exam<br>- Consider UA/urine culture, chest x-ray, sputum cultures, blood cultures, Stool for C. difficile, and abdominal labs for pancreatitis or hepatitis, as appropriate<br>- If patient has a central line, send blood cultures from both the periphery and the line|
|Step 6: Treatment<br><br>- Acetaminophen and NSAIDS are both equally efficacious in treating fever. Acetaminophen is safer.<br>- Acetaminophen may be administered as a suppository in patients unable to take PO<br>- Treat fever more aggressively in patients with pre-existing cardiac, pulmonary or cerebrovascular disease<br>- Start empiric broad spectrum antibiotics in case of strong clinical suspicion of bacterial infection, immunocompromised patients, asplenic patients and hypotensive patients. It is ok to wait to determine the source of infection before starting antibiotics in other patients with fever.|

# IV access issues on call

Approach to patient

|   |
|---|
|Step 1: Assess need for IV access<br><br>- Can the patient tolerate PO medications? If so, the need for restoring IV access is not as urgent in a stable patient.<br>- Are there any medications/infusions that must be given in IV form such as IV antibiotics, fluids or blood products? If a patient does not need anything IV and is overall stable, IV access may be deferred to the primary team.|
|Step 2: Attempt peripheral line <br><br>- Peripheral line can be attempted by the bedside nurse, intern, resident or the Vascular Access Team (VAT)*, depending upon protocols in place at your site. The VAT or IV access team may be able to use ultrasound guidance to insert a peripheral line.|
|Step 3: Peripheral line cannot be obtained<br><br>- If a peripheral line cannot be obtained, consider a midline, PICC line or Internal Jugular (IJ)/External Jugular (EJ) access. Midline is not as long as a PICC and is preferred due to lower theoretical risk for infection. Midlines can stay in place for 2-4 weeks but may not be suitable for irritant infusions such as parenteral nutrition. Midline is usually attempted by VAT team, PICC line can be placed by VAT team or interventional radiology, and IJ/EJ access is typically obtained by interns or residents. Some institutions have bedside procedure teams staffed by hospitalist physicians that can assist with IJ/EJ placement.|

*Usually run by certified nurses

# Diarrhea on call

Approach to patient

|   |
|---|
|Step 1: Over the phone<br><br>- Request the nurse obtain a complete set of vitals<br>- Order IV access if not already available|
|Step 2: Upon arrival at the bedside<br><br>- Review vital signs <br>- Review chart for recent antibiotic use (think Clostridium difficile), laxative use and history of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) or Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)<br>- Obtain a focused history: <br>    - How frequent are the loose stools? Patients with frequent diarrhea usually need to be hydrated with IV fluids.<br>    - Are any other symptoms present? Abdominal pain and fever may be suggestive of Clostridium difficile colitis, while nausea/vomiting may be suggestive of gastroenteritis or partial small bowel obstruction.<br>    - Is there a history of previous abdominal surgeries (think partial small bowel obstruction)? <br>    - Does the patient have a preceding history of constipation (think overflow diarrhea)?<br>    - Does the patient have a history of opioid abuse and opioids have been recently stopped or drastically decreased (think diarrhea from opioid withdrawal)?<br>- Perform a focused exam: <br>    - Tachycardia and dry mucous membranes are suggestive of dehydration<br>    - Abdominal distension suggests partial small bowel obstruction, while abdominal tenderness can be seen in C. diff colitis, IBD flare and gastroenteritis<br>    - Rectal exam may be helpful if blood per rectum is suspected, such as suspected IBD flare <br>    - Look at stool sample if available in the commode for presence of bright red blood or melena|
|Step 4: Laboratory tests<br><br>- Order fecal leukocytes<br>- Order stool cultures if bacterial gastroenteritis is suspected<br>- Order stool C. difficile testing if C. diff colitis is suspected|
|Step 5: Management<br><br>- Hydration: Provide PO fluids for mild dehydration and IV fluids for moderate or severe dehydration<br>- Symptomatic therapy: <br>    - Loperamide 2-4 mg PO is acceptable in the absence of fever, bloody stool, and absence of leukocytes in stools<br>    - Discontinue laxatives|
# Hypoxia-on call

Approach to the patient

|   |
|---|
|Step 1: While on the phone:<br><br>- Request the nurse obtain a complete set of vital signs<br>- Place verbal order for continuous pulse oximetry and telemetry<br>- Go to the bedside|
|Step 2: Upon arrival at the bedside:<br><br>- Secure ABC’s<br>- Review vital signs<br>- Administer oxygen to keep oxygen saturation ≥92% (≥88% in patients with known COPD)<br>- Review chart and perform focused H&P<br>- History: <br>    - Does the patient feel SOB? For how long?  <br>    - Does the patient have associated symptoms such as cough, chest pain or fever?<br>    - Is the patient taking any narcotics or benzodiazepines? <br>    - Does the patient have a history of smoking (think COPD)?<br>    - Does the patient have a documented history of COPD, PE, DVT, CHF, Obstructive sleep apnea or Obesity/Obesity hypoventilation syndrome, pulmonary hypertension or asthma? All of these conditions can present with hypoxia.<br>    - Does the patient have risk factors for aspiration, such as H/O CVA, G-tube feeds or recent episodes of depressed consciousness with vomiting?     <br>    - Did the patient have a recent central line placed in their internal jugular vein (think pneumothorax)?<br>- Exam: <br>    - Review heart rate and temperature<br>    - Assess mental status-hypoxia can cause altered mental status, and patients with depressed mental status are at risk for aspiration<br>    - Measure JVP-elevated JVP is suggestive of congestive heart failure<br>    - Auscultate heart and lungs-wheezing is suggestive of COPD or asthma exacerbation, or cardiac asthma, and crackles are suggestive of heart failure exacerbation and pneumonia<br>    - Assess for edema/calf swelling-bilateral swelling is suggestive of CHF, while unilateral swelling is suggestive of DVT/PE<br>    - Look for calf tenderness, which can be seen in DVT/PE<br>    - Look for obesity, which can be suggestive of obesity hypoventilation syndrome<br>    - Assess use of accessory muscles and ability to speak in full sentences as markers of severity of the underlying disease process|
|Step 4: Laboratory studies to identify underlying cause:<br><br>- Obtain Chest x-ray if the cause of hypoxia is unclear or to confirm the cause if you are making a new diagnosis<br>- Obtain ABG if cause of hypoxia remains unclear <br>- Consider BNP, cardiac markers, D-dimer, CT chest with/without IV contrast and 2D echo, as appropriate|
|Step 5: Analyzing the ABG to determine the cause of hypoxia:<br><br>- Look for three things: paCO2, A-a gradient (Alveolar arterial gradient, calculated by plugging in values from ABG into calculators) and the ease with which hypoxia corrects with O2. Four scenarios emerge:<br>    - An elevated paCO2 with a normal A-a gradient* indicates central hypoventilation syndromes (e.g., obesity hypoventilation syndrome) or neuromuscular disorders<br>    - An elevated or normal paCO2, an elevated A-a gradient and rapid correction with inspired O2 points towards a Ventilation/Perfusion (V/Q) mismatch. This is the most common clinical category, and includes asthma, COPD, interstitial lung disease, PE, pulmonary hypertension and pneumonia.<br>    - An elevated or normal paCO2, an elevated A-a gradient and relative lack of correction with inspired O2 points towards a shunt. Causes include atelectasis, alveolar filling as in severe pneumonia, pulmonary edema, intracardiac shunts, pulmonary shunts as in Osler-Weber-Rendu and hepatic cirrhosis.<br>    - A normal paCO2 and a normal A-a gradient points towards a decrease in inspired O2. Causes include high altitudes, anesthesia and smoke inhalation during a fire.|
|Step 6: Interventions:<br><br>- Intubation is required if:<br>    - Oxygenation does not improve despite non-invasive supplementation (oxygen saturation below 90% despite FiO2 greater than 60%)<br>    - Patient cannot protect their airway due to altered mental status or loss of gag reflex<br>    - Acute hypercarbic respiratory failure ensues (paCO2 greater than 50 mmHg and pH less 7.27)<br>- Non-invasive ventilation with BiPAP** is particularly useful in cases of hypercarbic respiratory failure.  BiPAP can generally be initiated with an IPAP of 12 and EPAP of 5 with a suitable FiO2 (e.g., order written as BiPAP at 12/5 with FiO2 of 40%). <br>- Supplemental oxygen may be provided by several means:<br>    - Start with oxygen via nasal cannula. May go up to 5-6L/min<br>    - Venturi Masks deliver higher FiO2 than nasal cannula. They can be set at 40%, 50% etc.<br>    - 100% non-rebreather offers the highest non-ventilatory FiO2 available.<br>-  Specific interventions based on underlying condition:<br>    - For suspected/confirmed asthma attack/COPD exacerbation, give:<br>        - Albuterol 2.5 mg & ipratropium 0.5 mg nebs q 2-4 hours<br>    - Consider prednisone 40 mg PO and azithromycin for COPD exacerbations and prednisone 40-80 mg for asthma exacerbations<br>    - For CHF exacerbations, consider furosemide 20-40 mg IV (based on blood pressure and renal function)|

*Normal A-a gradient can be calculated using the equation: 2.5 + 0.21 X age in years

**Contraindications to BiPAP: Uncooperative patient, facial trauma, excessive secretions, hypotension, life-threatening epistaxsis

  
# Hypomagnesemia on call

Approach to patient

|   |
|---|
|Symptomatic hypomagnesemia/arrhythmias present<br><br>Magnesium sulfate IV<br><br>- If plasma magnesium < 1 mg/dL, give 4-8 grams over 12-24 hours<br>- If plasma magnesium 1-1.5 mg/dL, give 2-4 grams over 4-12 hours<br>- If plasma magnesium 1.6-1.9 mg/dL, give 1-2 grams over 1-2 hours<br><br>Magnesium chloride 50 mmol continuous infusion/ day (preferable in case of hypocalcemia as magnesium sulfate lowers calcium levels)|
|Asymptomatic hypomagnesemia<br><br>Magnesium oxide 400 mg 2-3 times a day <br><br>Magnesium chloride/magnesium lactate (sustained release preparation)<br><br>- Plasma magnesium < 1 mg/dL: 2 tablets 3 times daily<br>- Plasma magnesium 1-1.5mg/dL: 2 tablets 2 times daily<br><br>Plasma magnesium >1.5 mg/dL: 2 tablets once daily|

# Hypotension on call

Approach to patient

|   |
|---|
|Step 1:  Go directly to the bedside|
|Step 2:  Bedside assessment:<br><br>- Re-measure the Blood Pressure (BP) yourself, preferably manually<br>- Determine if the patient is experiencing systemic hypoperfusion secondary to the hypotension. Two things are required to make this determination: patient’s baseline BP and evidence of end organ hypoperfusion.<br>- Obtain complete vitals. Patients in shock secondary to hypotension are usually tachycardic. This response may be blunted in patients on beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers.<br>-  If BP is below patient’s baseline, look for signs and symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion (for example, dizziness, confusion, focal weakness, visual changes), renal hypoperfusion (low urine output and elevated serum creatinine) and skin hypoperfusion (increased capillary refill time and cool extremities).|
|Step 3:  Look for an etiology for the patient’s hypotension:<br><br>- Iatrogenic: Look for recent increase in dosage of antihypertensive medications, aggressive diuresis, opioids and benzodiazepines<br>- Hypovolemia: Review the chart for recent surgery (think bleeding from surgical site), patient on anticoagulation (think bleeding, such as gastrointestinal or retroperitoneal bleed), severe diarrhea and polyuria (>3-4 L of urine/day)<br>- Sepsis: Look for fever, leukocytosis and focal signs of infection <br>- Cardiac causes: Consider bradycardia, tachycardia, congestive heart failure, valvular lesions, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection and cardiac tamponade as potential causes<br>- Intravascular volume depletion: Low oncotic pressure (in conditions such as cirrhosis and nephrotic syndrome) and “third spacing” from systemic inflammatory response (in conditions such as pancreatitis and burn injuries) can lead to hypotension<br>- Pulmonary causes: Pneumothorax and large pulmonary embolism can be associated with sudden onset hypotension<br>- Adrenal causes: Patients on daily home steroids and patients who have had multiple courses of steroids over the past year are prone to adrenal insufficiency which can lead to low blood pressure in the hospital|
|Step 4: Management:<br><br>- The top priority in a patient in shock is to restore circulation. Start a bolus of normal saline (500 cc is a good place to start, reduce to 250 cc if dealing with a dialysis patient/ patient with low ejection fraction). Intravascular volume expansion should be done with fluid boluses and not with maintenance fluids. Repeat BP every hour.<br>- Consider underlying etiology. If a patient needs to be in the ICU for the underlying etiology of hypotension (most cardiac and pulmonary causes), transfer to ICU. Have a low threshold for ICU transfer if a patient has risk factors for volume overload with volume resuscitation (dialysis, low ejection fraction). In fact, all but iatrogenic causes of hypotension may need ICU transfer. The following may usually be safely tried prior to ICU transfer:<br>    - Up to 2 liters of 0.9 normal saline in a septic patient who is otherwise stable (no altered mental status, heart rate stable/improving and stable oxygen saturation)<br>    - Up to 2 liters of 0.9 normal saline in a patient with severe vomiting/diarrhea as the cause of hypotension<br>    - Try to match input to output in patients with polyuria<br>    - Start empiric antibiotics in septic patients based on likely source<br>    - Try 100-200 cc of 25% albumin IV in patients with intravascular volume depletion secondary to low oncotic pressure, such as cirrhosis and nephrotic syndrome|

# Leaving AMA (Against Medical Advice) on call

Approach to patient

|   |
|---|
|Step 1: Assess competence<br><br>- Review the chart to determine if the patient has been deemed competent or incompetent <br>- If unclear, or if there has been a change in patient’s clinical condition, perform an in-person assessment and involve your supervising resident. In-person assessment should cover orientation to time, place and person, an understanding of the underlying medical issues being treated and an understanding of the consequences of leaving AMA, at a minimum. A patient who is not alert, oriented X 3 and who lacks understanding is typically not competent to leave AMA.<br>- Do not allow an incompetent patient to leave AMA|
|Step 2: Encourage patient to stay<br><br>- Be polite, apologetic, conciliatory, and empathetic. Remain non-judgmental and pleasant. <br>- Listen to the patient’s reasons for leaving<br>- Discuss their concerns and suggest safe solutions<br>- Explain the benefits of continuing treatment, and the risks of leaving AMA in layman terms.  Be specific and verbal in mentioning all risks, including death. <br>- Consider involving family members in discussion to encourage patient to stay<br>- Compromise. For instance, if a patient doesn’t want blood draws, suggest less frequent blood draws.<br>- If pt insists on leaving, provide follow-up (f/u) instructions and discuss indications for return to the emergency room. It is ok to provide prescriptions for medications that will keep the patient safe in the short-term, such as antibiotics. Prescriptions for long-term medications (such as opioids) and medications requiring intensive monitoring (such as warfarin) should be deferred to the primary care provider.|
|Step 3: Document your efforts in the chart<br><br>- Provide details of conversation, including risks of leaving AMA, indications for return and instructions for f/u<br>- Have other health care workers who participated in AMA discussion also document in the chart|
|Step 4: Have patient sign the AMA form and provide AMA discharge paperwork|
|Step 5: Make sure your senior resident and the patient’s attending physician are aware of the AMA discharge|

# Headache on call

Approach to patient 

|   |
|---|
|Step 1: Go to the bedside for all new onset or acutely worsened headaches. Even though most headaches are due to non-emergent conditions such as migraines and tension headache, it is important to rule out emergent causes such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage, hypertensive emergency and meningitis.|
|Step 2: Obtain vital signs including pulse oximetry. Remember that hypoxia can lead to headache.|
|Step 3: Obtain history<br><br>- Does the patient have chronic, recurrent headaches?  If so, is the current headache similar to the patient’s chronic headaches?<br>- Red flags in a headache patient include sudden onset, onset after age 40, onset with cough/exertion, change from regular headache pattern, worsening of headache despite treatment and presence of focal neurological signs|
|Step 4: Perform a s focussed physical exam<br><br>- Head/Neck: Look for papilledema, neck stiffness, and pain on palpation of temporal arteries<br>- Neurological: Look for focal neurological deficits|
|Step 5: Laboratory studies<br><br>- Lab studies are generally unnecessary in patients under age 50, particularly if headache is consistent with previous pattern<br>- Head CT: Obtain if red flags are present<br>- Lumbar puncture: Obtain (after ruling out herniation) if meningitis is suspected (fever, neck stiffness)<br>- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate: Obtain if temporal arteritis is suspected (age > 50, jaw claudication, tenderness to palpation of temporal arteries)|
|Step 6: Management<br><br>- If no serious cause is suspected, give PO acetaminophen (500 mg -1000 mg) or NSAIDs (e.g., Ibuprofen 200-400 mg PO q6 hour) as first-line agent for non-migraine headaches. For migraines, consider metoclopramide 10 mg IV or sumatriptan 50 mg PO. Triptans are contraindicated in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease and uncontrolled hypertension.|
# Respiratory depression on call

Approach to the patient with respiratory depression

|   |
|---|
|Step 1: Go directly to the bedside|
|Step 2: <br><br>- Determine respiratory rate and evaluate pattern by observing patient for 1 minute<br>- Review other vital signs and evaluate Airway, Breathing and Circulation (ABC’s)<br>- Perform a focused assessment to determine the cause of respiratory depression:<br>    - Look for obesity – think obesity hypoventilation syndrome<br>    - Look for other signs of opioid intoxication – constricted pupils are suggestive of opioid<br>    - overdose<br>    - Look for a history of benzodiazepine administration<br>    - Look for a history of COPD – think Carbon Dioxide (CO2) retention<br>    - Look for signs and symptoms of stroke<br>    - Look for renal insufficiency on labs-opioids are more likely accumulate in a patient with renal insufficiency|
|Step 3:<br><br>- Obtain pulse oximetry and send Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) analysis. If a patient has had ABG in the past and the cause of respiratory depression is clear, a repeat ABG may not be necessary.<br>- Consider Head CT if there is suspicion of stroke|
|Step 4:<br><br>- Consider naloxone in suspected opioid intoxication and flumazenil in suspected benzodiazepine intoxication. Flumazenil can cause withdrawal seizures and should be used sparingly. For suspected opioids overdose, give naloxone 0.4-2 mg q 2-3 minutes. Repeat dose may be required 20-30 minutes later. Patients who need repeated doses of naloxone may need a naloxone infusion in the ICU.<br>- Consider BiPAP in patients with CO2 retention. Inability to protect the airway is a contraindication to BiPAP.<br>- Consider intubation/code if unable to protect airway or condition is deteriorating on BiPAP|

# Hypoglycemia On-Call

Approach to patient

Step 1: Correct Blood sugar

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Situation|Intervention|
|Patient able to take PO and no neuroglycopenic symptoms|Give 20g glucose orally. This is most easily administered as four 5g glucose tablets. Otherwise, use juice or candy.|
|Patient unable to take PO or neuroglycopenic symptoms present|Give 100 cc of 25% dextrose IV (repeat as necessary until symptoms are resolved) followed by D5 at 100 cc/hr and frequent glucose checks.|
|IV dextrose not feasible*|Give glucagon 1 mg s/c|
|Have the patient eat as above measures will raise blood sugar only transiently|   |

*If the patient does not have a peripheral IV and one cannot be established

Step 2: Withhold current dose of insulin and oral hypoglycemics

*However, leave it to the primary team to make long-term changes in insulin regimen

Step 3: Repeat blood glucose measurement both to confirm resolution of hypoglycemia and to ensure patient’s blood sugar does not fall again

Helpful hints:

- Patients with depleted glycogen stores (alcoholics, liver disease patients) take longer to normalize their blood sugars
- Sulfonylureas have long half lives, especially in the setting of renal failure. Hypoglycemia frequently recurs in patients on these drugs.
- Hypoglycemia, if left untreated for long, can cause irreversible brain damage

# High blood pressure on call

Approach to patient

|   |
|---|
|Step 1: Over the phone, ask for exact BP.  Ask for trends. Determine baseline.  Ask for other vitals.  The crucial point is to determine if you are dealing with a hypertensive urgency Vs emergency.  The following questions help determine the likelihood of a hypertensive emergency:<br><br>- Presence of chest pain (myocardial ischemia or aortic dissection), shortness of breath (pulmonary edema), blood in patient’s urine, severe abdominal pain and focal neurological symptoms, including vision changes (CVA)<br>- Ascertain if you are dealing with a known stroke patient. Systolic BP goal of 160-180 is reasonable in these patients.|
|Step 2: <br><br>- Go to the bedside if there is any suspicion of hypertensive emergency. Patients with hypertensive emergencies typically need to be managed with an IV infusion of antihypertensive medications in the intensive care unit.<br>- Does the patient have hypertensive urgency with symptoms such as headache, epistaxis or atypical chest pain that may be attributable to high blood pressure? Is the patient being treated for a heart failure exacerbation or another condition where blood pressure control is a part of the management plan? If so, administer rapid acting oral agents to address blood pressure.|
|Step 3:<br><br>- If you are dealing with hypertensive urgency with symptoms, consider using rapid acting oral agents such as labetalol (200-400 mg, avoid if heart rate is less than 65), clonidine (0.1-0.3 mg), captopril (25-50 mg, avoid in renal insufficiency), or prazosin (5-10 mg). If a patient cannot take PO, IV enalapril (0.625-1.25 mg IV q 6 prn, avoid in renal insufficiency) or IV hydralazine (10 mg IV q 6 prn) can usually be used safely on general medical floors without tele-monitoring. <br>- For asymptomatic  patients with systolic blood pressure greater than 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure greater than 110 mmHg, consider giving an earlier dose of already-prescribed antihypertensives<br>- For asymptomatic patients with systolic blood pressure less than 180 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure less than 110 mmHg, pharmacologic management is typically not required<br>- Address other common causes of elevated blood pressure such as pain, anxiety and alcohol/drug withdrawal for all patients with elevated blood pressure|

# Holding medications on call

Approach to patient

 It is the responsibility of the primary team to withhold medications prior to tests/procedures.  Nonetheless, this responsibility may sometimes be forgotten, or tests/procedures may be ordered when no member of the primary team is in the hospital.  Therefore, it will sometimes fall on the on-call resident to withhold medications.

|   |
|---|
|Step 1: Assess the situation (the entire process may often be done over the phone)<br><br>- Ask the indication for holding the medication(s) (e.g., upcoming test/procedure)<br>- Balance the indication against the necessity of the medication(s)|
|Step 2: Placing orders based on procedure<br><br>- For any test/procedure involving anesthesia, make the patient NPO after midnight<br>- For invasive procedures, hold aspirin and other antiplatelet/anticoagulant agents. While holding antiplatelet agents is not always necessary, it may be the safest route to ensure the procedure does not need to be cancelled.<br>- For studies involving IV contrast, withhold metformin<br>- For cardiac stress test, withhold rate-lowering medications (B-blockers, calcium channel blockers). Rate lowering medications should also typically be held if the patient’s heart rate is less than 65/minute.<br>- For patients going for surgery, decisions on holding or continuing medications depend upon the medication. The medication management section of the [https://www.preopevalguide.com](https://www.preopevalguide.com/) is an excellent resource to determine if a medication can be safely continued in the perioperative setting.|

# Trouble sleeping on call

Approach to the patient

|   |
|---|
|Step 1: Over the phone:<br><br>- Ask whether the patient has received any sleeping aids in the past or has a history of insomnia<br>- Ask if the patient has a history of dementia or exhibits signs or symptoms of delirium<br>- Ask if the patient is in pain<br>- Review home medications to see if patient is on hypnotics that have been held during hospitalization|
|Step 2: Determining course of action:<br><br>- If you are confident that no dementia or delirium is present, a verbal order for sleep aid is ok<br>- If there is concern for dementia or delirium, avoid hypnotics<br>- Go to the bedside and treat pain if that appears to be the primary issue|
|Step 3: Options for sleep aid: <br><br>- Melatonin is the safest agent to use in this setting. The usual dose is 3 mg, with the option of using 6 mg if the patient has tried 3 mg in the past without effect.<br>- Benadryl 25 mg, zolpidem 10 mg, zaleplon 10 mg, temazepam 15 mg, lorazepam 0.5 mg and eszopiclone 2 mg are the various other agents that can be used on a case-by-case basis. All of these medications should be avoided in elderly patients and patients with underlying cirrhosis. If used in these patient populations, use half of the listed dose. It should be noted, however, that abrupt discontinuation of these medications in the inpatient setting can lead to withdrawal symptoms. Patients who have been taking these medications chronically at home should be continued on them unless adverse effects are suspected.|
# Tachycardia on call

Approach to patient

|

| Step 3: If a trip to the bedside is indicated:<br><br>- Review telemetry, repeat BP and HR yourself, perform a focused assessment for underlying causes of tachycardia such as pain, dehydration, bleeding, anxiety and infection, and review medications. In particular, note if the patient is on Atrio-Ventricular (AV) nodal blocking agents such as beta-blockers, diltiazem and digoxin. The patient’s actual heart rate is probably higher than what you are seeing on the monitor in such patients.<br>- Obtain 12 lead EKG and interpret rhythm



| Step 4: Further management is based on rhythm:<br><br>- Sinus tachycardia: <br>    - Determine if patient is in pain, anxious or febrile, and treat as appropriate<br>    - Evaluate volume status. Dry mucous membranes, orthostasis and blood urea nitrogen/creatinine suggest dehydration suggest dehydration, and tachycardia may respond to fluid boluses in such patients. <br>    - Look for anemia and transfuse packed red blood cells if patient meets criteria for transfusion<br>    - Determine last alcohol intake. Alcohol withdrawal is a common cause of tachycardia in the inpatient setting and responds to benzodiazepines.<br>    - Sinus tachycardia may need to be treated with IV metoprolol (5 mg IV, repeat every 2 minutes X 3 as needed) in patients with underlying coronary artery disease or aortic stenosis. Otherwise, it is more important to treat the cause of tachycardia.<br><br>- Narrow complex tachycardia (except sinus tachycardia) (QRS < 120 ms): <br>- Causes include:<br>    - Sino-Atrial Reentrant Tachycardia (SANRT)<br>    - AV Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia (AVNRT), further divided into common and uncommon AVNRT<br>    - AV reentrant Tachycardia (AVRT) with orthodromic conduction is a narrow complex tachycardia, while AVRT with antidromic conduction is a wide complex tachycardia. The accessory pathway in AVRT may be slow or fast conducting.<br>    - Atrial Tachycardia (AT)<br>    - Junctional tachycardia<br>- Determine if the patient is hemodynamically stable. If a patient is hypotensive, perform electric cardioversion. It is useful to quickly determine a patient's baseline BP, as many patient’s run low blood pressures at baseline.<br>- Determine if the rhythm is regular or irregular<br>    - Irregularly irregular rhythm with no discrete pattern is either atrial fibrillation (AF) or Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia (MAT). No P waves are seen in AF. In MAT, at least 3 different P waves with variable morphologies and variable PR intervals are seen. <br>    - If the rhythm is regular, look for P waves<br>        -  If there are no discernible P waves, give adenosine to unmask underlying rhythm. Adenosine may convert the rhythm to sinus, in which case you are dealing with AVNRT, AVRT, SANRT or some form of AT.<br>        - If P waves are discernible, look for 2 things: P wave morphology and RP interval:<br>            - P wave morphology may be normal, retrograde (inverted P waves in 2, 3 and aVF, and upright P waves in V1), or abnormal (any morphology that cannot be labeled as normal or retrograde). It is helpful to compare P waves to P waves seen in sinus rhythm. <br>            - RP interval should be categorized as short or long. An RP interval that is more than 50% of the RR interval is long<br>        - Look for the following permutations once you have looked at P wave morphology and RP interval:<br>            - Abnormal P wave morphology and long RP interval: Atrial tachycardia<br>            - Abnormal P waves and short RP interval: Atrial tachycardia with AV nodal delay<br>            - Retrograde P waves and long RP interval: Uncommon AVNRT, AVRT with slow accessory pathway<br>            - Retrograde P waves and short RP interval: Common AVNRT, Orthodromic AVRT, AT that originates very close to the AV node and accelerated junctional rhythm. Retrograde P waves can be seen just before the QRS complex in junctional tachycardia.<br>            - Atrial rate 250 or greater with flutter waves: Atrial flutter<br>            - AV dissociation with ventricular rate greater than atrial rate: Junctional Tachycardia<br><br>It is reasonable to use adenosine to terminate regular narrow complex tachycardias. One exception is patients with underlying Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome whose underlying tachyarrhythmia is Atrial Fibrillation (AF). This applies to Wide Complex Tachycardias (WCT) where AF with WPW is suspected as well (see below). AF with underlying WPW can get converted into ventricular fibrillation if adenosine is given. It is therefore important to look for prior history of WPW and to look for delta waves (both resting EKG and the tachyarrhythmia) before giving adenosine. Also, carefully look to see if rhythm is irregular. Cardioversion or amiodarone is preferred in AF with WPW. The dosage of adenosine is 6 mg followed by 12 mg IV (if no response) (1-3 mg IV X 2 if giving via central line). Always have a defibrillator available when giving adenosine.<br><br><br>- Wide complex tachycardia (WCT, QRS >/= 120 ms): WCT originates from the ventricle (ventricular tachycardia) in 80% cases. This proportion goes up to 95% of those with prior MI. 20% of WCTs are supraventricular in origin. Any Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) such as sinus tachycardia, AF, A-Flutter, AVNRT, AVRT with orthodromic conduction and AT) can be wide complex if the patient has a bundle branch block along with the SVT. The bundle branch block may be fixed or rate dependent. SVTs that conduct anterogradely via accessory pathways (WPW syndrome) are also wide complex. AVRT with antidromic conduction is the best example. Sinus tachycardia, AT or A-flutter associated with antegrade conduction (6% of WCTs) via an accessory pathway can also present as WCTs.<br>    - Determine if the patient is hemodynamically stable. If not, cardioversion is indicated.<br>    - In a hemodynamically stable patient, the major question is if the patient has VT or SVT with aberration. The following features, put together, help distinguish VT from SVT with aberration. Of note, in context of VT, an RBBB pattern refers to positive QRS polarity in V1 and V2, and an LBBB pattern refers to negative QRS polarity in V1 and V2:<br>        - Look for AV dissociation (25% sensitivity, 100% specificity)<br>        - Rate: A-flutter with aberration usually has a ventricular rate of 150/min. Therefore, an exact rate of 150/min should always prompt consideration of this arrhythmia.<br>        - Rhythm: VT is generally regular. Slight variation in RR intervals occurs with monomorphic VT, while marked variation in RR interval indicates polymorphic VT or AF with aberration.<br>        - Axis: <br>            - QRS axis that is -90 degrees to +/- 180 degrees (right superior axis) indicates VT<br>            - In a patient with a RBBB like WCT, QRS axis to the left of -30 degrees suggests VT<br>            - In a patient with an LBBB like WCT, QRS axis to the right of +90 degrees suggests VT<br>        - QRS duration:<br>            - In a patient with a RBBB like WCT, QRS duration of greater than 140 msec suggests VT<br>            -  In a patient with an LBBB like WCT, QRS duration of greater than 160 msec suggests VT<br>        - Brugada criterion:<br><br>1. 1. 1. 1. Look for RS complexes in all precordial leads. If there are none, VT is diagnosed. Similar polarity of all precordial leads (all positive or all negative, with absence of RS complexes) is called concordance. Concordance has a 90% specificity and 20% sensitivity for VT.<br>            2. If RS complex is present, look for RS duration (from onset of R to nadir of S). RS duration of more than 100 msec favors VT. <br>            3. If RS duration is less than 100 msec, look for AV dissociation. AV dissociation is diagnostic of VT.<br>            4. If RS duration is less than 100 msec, and AV dissociation cannot be assessed, look for the following:<br><br>- - - - - RBBB pattern: A monophasic R or a biphasic qR in lead V1/V2 favors VT. A typical RSR’ pattern in V1 is more common in SVT with aberration (70%) than in VT with RBBB morphology (6%). Even if the pattern is not typical, R’>R in V1 favors SVT over VT. Further, an rS complex in lead V6 favors VT, while an Rs complex favors SVT with aberration.<br>                - LBBB pattern: R wave duration greater than 40 msec in V1 and a QS duration of >60 msec (from onset of QRS to nadir of S) favors VT<br><br>  <br>- - Management of VT in a hemodynamically stable patient focuses on rhythm conversion by cardioversion and correcting underlying pathology (such as ischemia, drug toxicity or electrolyte abnormality). Amiodarone is the preferred pharmacological agent to suppress recurrent VTs. Amiodarone is also appropriate for WCTs when the distinction between SVT with aberration and VT cannot be made.<br>    - SVT with aberration is managed in the same way as narrow complex SVTs |

# Agitated patient in the on-call setting

- Encounters with violent patients are most common in the emergency room and psychiatric ward.  As a resident you may also be called to assess violent patients on the medicine floors.
- The first step is to determine if the patient is intoxicated/withdrawing, delirious, psychotic or angry.  A delirious patient is disoriented and has an impaired attention span.

Causes-agitated patient

|   |
|---|
|Drug Intoxication and Withdrawal <br><br>- Alcohol<br>- Stimulants (cocaine, methamphetamines, PCP)<br>- Sedative hypnotics|
|Psychiatric disease<br><br>- Schizophrenia<br>- Mania<br>- Psychotic depression<br>- Personality disorder|
|Organic<br><br>- Dementia, including dementia with Lewy bodies<br>- Traumatic brain injury<br>- Delirium-causes of delirium are listed in the table below|

Causes of Delirium

|   |
|---|
|CNS disorder<br><br>- Meningitis/encephalitis/abscess<br>- Stroke<br>- Seizure<br>- Hypertensive encephalopathy|
|Systemic Infection/Sepsis|
|Metabolic<br><br>- Electrolyte imbalance<br>- Hypoglycemia<br>- Hypoxemia/Hypercarbia<br>- Uremia<br>- Wernicke’s encephalopathy (thiamine deficiency)<br>- Other nutritional deficiencies (B12, folate, niacin)<br>- Hypo or hyperthyroidism<br>- Hypo or hyperadrenalism|
|Drug-Associated<br><br>- Polypharmacy<br>- Anticholinergics<br>- Sedative/hypnotics<br>- Narcotics<br>- Drug side-effect|
|Other<br><br>- Genetic (porphyria, Wilson’s disease)<br>- Organ failure (cardiac, renal, hepatic)<br>- Hypo or Hyperthermia<br>- Trauma|
|Constipation|

Approach to the agitated patient

|   |
|---|
|Step 1:  Prepare for a safe encounter<br><br>- Ensure that no dangerous objects (scissors, needles, scalpels) are visible in patient’s room<br>- Inform security/ancillary staff of security concern, preferably without alarming the patient<br>- Position yourself between the patient and the door while performing the initial assessment|
|Step 2 :Verbal Techniques and Patient Consolation<br><br>- Be non-confrontational and honest, speak in a calm voice, and respect the patient’s space<br>- Be conciliatory (offer food, drink, blankets, etc.) <br>- Inquire about homicidal and suicidal thoughts|
|Step 3:Physical restraints<br><br>- Indications: <br>    - Patient risks harm to him/herself or others <br>    - Patient is disrupting important treatments such as pulling IV lines and telemetry leads<br>    - Restraints are part of an effective ongoing treatment program and should not be used as the only means of managing an agitated patient<br>- Physical restraints must be applied by a trained restraint team<br>- Document indication and anticipated duration for restraints. If you are placing physical restraints on a patient for the first time, have your senior resident concur with the need for restraints.|
|Step 4: Chemical restraints<br><br>- Benzodiazepines (Lorazepam 0.5-2.0 mg IV or IM) are the preferred first agent in patients with alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal<br>- Antipsychotics are preferred in psychosis (haloperidol 2.5-5 mg IM) or delirium. Dosing of antipsychotics in patients with delirium is outlined below:<br>    - Haloperidol 0.5-1 mg IM every 30-60 minutes. Repeat if the initial dose is ineffective. Make sure QTc in not prolonged. Extrapyramidal side effects become more pronounced once daily dose exceeds 3 mg. IV formulation of haloperidol can be used, but remember it has a short half-life.<br>    - A rapidly dissolving oral formulation of risperidone is available (0.5 -1 mg initial dose, maximum daily dose 2 mg) and has a faster onset of action<br>    - Olanzapine 2.5 mg IM initial dose increase in 2.5 mg increments every 30 minutes if needed to a maximum dose of 7.5 mg. Peak effect 15-45 minutes after injection.<br>    - Lorazepam 0.5 mg – 1 mg PO every 4 hours as needed. Indicated if delirium is secondary to alcohol/sedative withdrawal, or if antipsychotics cannot be used, such as in patients with Parkinson’s disease and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. <br>- Combination therapy with benzodiazepines or antipsychotics may be used if the primary treatment modality is ineffective<br>- Watch for respiratory depression with benzodiazepine use<br>- Obtain EKG to assess QT interval with antipsychotic use. Antipsychotics can lead to ventricular arrhythmias in patients with prolonged QT interval.|
|Step 5: Search for and address underlying causes<br><br>- Obtain vital signs including pulse oximetry, blood glucose, and basic metabolic screen. Obtain a toxicology screen if intoxication is suspected.<br>- Perform complete mental status and neurological exam<br>- If a specific etiology is suspected, perform the appropriate corresponding test(s)<br>- Treat organic cause if identified.  If organic causes are ruled out, obtain psychiatry consult.|
|Step 6:Reassessment<br><br>- For patients on physical/chemical restraints, reassess frequently and discontinue when no longer indicated|

# Transfusion reactions on call

see [[Transfusion Reactions\|Transfusion Reactions]]
The various common transfusion reactions, their clinical features, laboratory studies you need to order, and initial management is provided below

|   |
|---|
|Acute Hemolytic reaction-occurs in <24 hours of starting transfusion:<br><br>  <br><br>Cause: Lysis of donor erythrocytes by recipient alloantibodies. Usually secondary to ABO incompatibility, but may be caused by alloantibodies to Rh, Kell and Duffy antigens.<br><br>  <br><br>Clinical features: Fever, chills, flank/chest pain, brown urine, hypotension, tachycardia and discomfort at infusion site. Renal failure and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation can occur.<br><br>  <br><br>Laboratory studies: Hemoglobin and hematocrit,haptoglobin, Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) and bilirubin to establish hemolysis. Send patient’s post transfusion blood sample and any unused blood to blood bank for testing.<br><br>  <br><br>Treatment:  MEDICAL EMERGENCY. Place the patient on 100-200 cc/hour normal saline and provide 250-500 cc boluses for low blood pressure.  Monitor urine output.  Give diuretics if necessary, to maintain output.  Monitor for hyperkalemia and DIC.|
|Febrile Non-Hemolytic Reaction (FNHTR)-occurs in <24 hours of starting transfusion. Incidence is 0.11-0.19%. Most common form of immunologic transfusion reaction.<br><br>  <br><br>Cause:  Caused by recipient antibodies to donor leukocytes/ HLA antigens<br><br>  <br><br>Clinical features: A rise in temperature by >/= 1.8-degree F, chills, and rigors<br><br>  <br><br>Treatment: Stop transfusion. Order hemoglobin and hematocrit, haptoglobin, LDH and DAT to look for hemolysis. Start IVF and monitor urine output till acute hemolytic reaction has been ruled out. FNHTR is benign.  Give antipyretics. Leukoreduction reduces chances of future FNHTR.|
|Delayed hemolytic reaction-occurs 2-10 days post-transfusion: <br><br>  <br><br>Cause: Caused by low level of alloantibodies in recipient, difficult to detect pre-transfusion. After transfusion, an anamnestic response occurs and causes hemolysis. <br><br>Clinical features: Mild fever, drop in hemoglobin and increase in bilirubin.<br><br>  <br><br>Treatment: Cannot be prevented. Rarely severe and treatment is rarely necessary.  Document for future transfusions.|
|Urticarial reaction:<br><br>  <br><br>Cause: IgE response of recipient blood to allergens in donor blood<br><br>  <br><br>Clinical features:  Minor reaction. Hives, itching and rash may be seen.<br><br>  <br><br>Treatment: Stop transfusion. Give 25-50 mg PO diphenhydramine. Resume transfusion once rash is waning. Premedicate with diphenhydramine in susceptible patients.|
|Anaphylactic reaction:<br><br>  <br><br>Clinical features: Occurs seconds to minutes after transfusion of only milliliters of blood. Incidence 1:20,000-50,000. Clinical features include shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, bronchospasm, and angioedema.<br><br>  <br><br>Treatment: Stop transfusion. Give epinephrine 0.5-1 mL of 1:1,000 subcutaneously. Secure Airway, Breathing and Circulation (ABC).|
|Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)<br><br>  <br><br>Cause: High titer anti-HLA antibodies present in donor plasma leading to aggregation of recipient leukocytes in the pulmonary capillaries. Incidence: 04-0.10%. <br><br>  <br><br>Clinical features: Sudden onset dyspnea and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates<br><br>  <br><br>Treatment: Differentiate from volume overload based on absence of jugular venous distension, pedal edema and usually a normal brain natriuretic peptide. Treatment is supportive.|

# Code status revisions-on call

 Approach to patient 

|   |
|---|
|Step 1: Over the phone:<br><br>- Inquire about patient condition<br>- In stable patients, leave code revisions to the primary team<br>- In unstable patients, go to the bedside to revise code status|
|Step 2: Process of code status revision<br><br>- If your institution used paper-based orders, obtain a new code status sheet/order sheet.  Do not write revisions on previous sheet<br>- Determine that patient is competent. A competent patient is alert and oriented to time, place and person. He/she can understand the information (ask patient to repeat information provided and document in chart that patient understood information provided) and rationally decide on matter at hand (determine if patient understands seriousness of illness and ramifications of a Do not resuscitate decision). Involve your senior resident if you are unsure of the patient’s decisionality.<br>- Explain all aspects of code status in terms the patient can understand. Learn to make a distinction between pre-code and code situations. A codesituation refers to a situation where cardiac or respiratory arrest has occurred. Pre-codesituations that require clear directions include: (a) Intubation if breathing has slowed but not stopped (b) Chemical or electrical cardioversion in case of arrhythmias (c) Pressors in case of hypotension. Document patient’s wishes clearly.<br>- Obtain signature(s) as appropriate, especially if you are using a paper-based order sheet<br>- Place revised code status sheet in the chart and update the bedside registered nurse on any changes in the patient’s code status|

# pain on call

Approach to patient

|   |
|---|
|Step 1: Go to the bedside for new pain or significant worsening of existing pain|
|Step 2: Review vital signs and chart|
|Step 3: Review pain medications the patient may already be receiving|
|Step 4: Obtain history and perform a physical exam to try and determine the cause of the patient’s pain|
|Step 5: Pain management<br><br>- Once the source of pain is identified, begin pain management in absence of contraindications<br>- Pay special attention to the patient’ creatinine (NSAIDS and morphine)<br>- The 3-step analgesic ladder (see below) is a helpful resource in managing acute pain|

3-Step Analgesic Ladder

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Pain Severity|Agent|Route and dosing|Important points|
|First Rung* (Mild pain, 1 to 4 on a scale of 10)|Acetaminophen|325-650 mg PO q 4-6 hr PRN pain|Adjust dose for hepatic impairment|
|Ibuprofen|200-400 mg PO q 4-6 hr PRN pain|Avoid in cases of GI/brain hemorrhage, or severe renal/hepatic impairment.|
|Aspirin|325-650 mg PO q 4-6 hr PRN pain|Avoid in surgical settings, children with viral illness (Reye’s syndrome), hemorrhage, and severe renal/hepatic impairment.|

|Third Rung (Severe pain, 7 and above on a scale of 10)|Morphine|10 mg PO q4 hr (opioid naïve)<br><br>10-30 mg PO q 4 hr (exposed)<br><br>2.5-5 mg IV q 3-4 (naïve)<br><br>5-20 mg IM q 4 hr|Strong opioid.  Beware of respiratory depression, CNS depression, hypotension, bradycardia, and constipation (add laxative)|
|Hydromorphone|2-4 mg PO q 3-6 hr (naïve)<br><br>0.2-0.6 mg IV q 2-3 hr (naïve)<br><br>Higher doses for exposed|Strong opioid.  Beware of respiratory depression, CNS depression, hypotension, bradycardia, and constipation (add laxative)|
|Fentanyl|0.1 mg IV q 3-4 hr<br><br>50 mcg/hr every 72 hours (transdermal patch)<br><br>50-300 µg nasal spray|Extremely potent opioid.  Provides fastest onset of action.  Beware of respiratory depression, CNS depression, hypotension, bradycardia, and constipation|
|Oxycodone|2.5-5 mg q 3-4 hr|Strong opioid. Beware of respiratory depression, CNS depression, hypotension, bradycardia, and constipation (add laxative)|
|PCA Pump|Can be used for patients with severe, persistent pain. Avoid using basal rate|   |

Helpful hints:

- Always enquire about contraindications/ adverse effects associated with individual agents before starting a patient on these agents
- If multiple services are involved on a patient (e.g., post-operative patients), make sure one service is handling the pain medicines
- Be extra-cautious in elderly patients. Use lower doses, especially if a history of dementia or renal insufficiency is present
- If you start a patient on opiods on call, make sure a bowel regimen is ordered for the patient (e.g., senokot 17.2 mg PO qHS prn if no bowel movement since morning. Repeat next morning if no response)
