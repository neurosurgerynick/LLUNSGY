suspect in a person with neurologic disorders, or in a woman with [[Menopause\|Menopause]]

## Symptoms
inability to reach the restroom prior to voiding
NO symptoms of urethral hypermobility due to stress incontinence
## Pathophysiology
- overactive detrusor muscle
- "hyperactive detrusor"
- classical conditioning is responsible, we are the only species that learns how to urinate at certain times (flowing water, putting keys in the door)

Anybody with [[MS; Multiple Sclerosis\|MS; Multiple Sclerosis]] will have **urge incontinence**
Anybody who is [[perimenopause\|perimenopause]]
### Treatment
- pelvic floor strengthening
- weight loss
- timed voiding/bladder training
- limiting consumption of caffeine and alcohol
- Meds:
- oxybutinin (**M3 antagonist**) prevents the bladder from being hyperactive, relaxes the impulses from the bladder when the impulse arrives
- mirabegron (**b3 agonist**) can be used but for all intents and purposes forget about this helps it relax when stretched
