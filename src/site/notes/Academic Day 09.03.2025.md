## Pre-Surgical Conference

Initial treatment for hemifacial spasms is Botox injections
	Over time, patients will develop facial weakness with repeated botox injections
	Due to repeated botox inj. they can have an odd mixed picture of blepharospasm with facial paralysis
For evaluation of hemi-facial spasm, you can do a thin-sliced sequence MRI (FIESTA/SPACE), to look for a vascular loop (MRA not as helpful)
	Also make sure you get WITH CONTRAST to also evaluate for tumor as acoustic neuroma/vestibular schwannomas can be compressive lesions in this area 
	Looking at the 7th nerve on the T2WI; vascular loop from AICA (most commonly) or PICA or the vertebral artery
		Recall that the first few millimeters of the nerve are UN-myelinated (root entry/root exit zone) at the interface with the brainstem
		Described radiographically as compression near the cisternal component of the nerve
		AICA usually originates at the mid-basilar region
	Duplicated SCAs are not infrequent as an anatomic variant

### Open microvascular decompression for CNVII compression
- retrosigmoid craniotomy 
	- feel transverse sinus and feel below that, the skull concaves away from you, but you need that part parallel with the floor
	- 3 finger breadths behind the pinna for your incision
- positioning: pure lateral decubitus on a bean bag, or supine with big bumps and head turned with lateral flexion
	- drawback of supine: for large patients, this can make the surgery nearly impossible
	- drawback of lateral (upward shoulder is in your way, you must tape it caudally to get more room for your hands)
	- pro of lateral positioning: less head rotation = less compression of venous return = more brain relaxation
5th nerve
- The tent is a great landmark to use if you follow it, it leads to the 5th cranial nerve
- burrhole by the TS junction leads to the tent
7th nerve
- you want your burrhole below the TS junction to get you down to the level of the root entry zone of CNVII
- start to reveal the TS junction slowly by undermining with a Penfield and using Kerrisons to eggshell the burrhole
- the flocculus is a portion of the cerebellum that is a landmark; there is also a small tuft of choroid plexus in that area

## Chiari Malformation
[[Chiari Malformation\|Chiari Malformation]]

## Cervical Anatomy
Most cervical lordosis (2/3) is in the lower cervical spine
Most cervical disc hernaitions are at/near the junctonal levels C5-6 and C6-7
Reduced disc height leads to altered weight loading, favoring the facet joints and ligaments as opposed to the vertebral bodies
20% of patients do not have the classic signs of myelopathy (Hoffman's, Babinski, Clonus)
Indication for [[Spine/ACDF\|ACDF]] is a single-level disc without any facet joint arthrosis, in a young patient
10% in 10 years is the risk of adjacent segment disease

Laminectomy and fusion versus Laminoplasty
	kyphosis, you want to fuse 
	older patients can benefit from laminoplasty
	unstable spine is bad for laminoplasty, get flexion extension x-rays to evaluate for instability before considering

## Deformity surgery
Sagittal balance is the most important, a line dropped vertically from the center of the hips
Key Sagittal Cervical Alignment Parameters
1. C2-C7 modified Cobb Angle
	1. Bottom of C2 endplate and Bottom of C7 endplate and measure angle between the perpendicular lines
	2. ![Pasted image 20250903093607.png](/img/user/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250903093607.png)
2. C2-C7 Sagittal Vertical Axis (cSVA)
	1. DISTANCE FROM BLUMB LINE DROPPED FROM C2 ODONOTOID TO POSTERIOR SUPERIOR CORNER OF C7
	2. ![Pasted image 20250903093758.png](/img/user/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250903093758.png)
	3. POOR QUALITY OF LIFE IF >4 CM OF DEFORMITY
3. Chin-Brow Vertical Angle (CBVA)
	1. SHOULD BE <10 DEGREES

JNS Ames Classification
![Pasted image 20250903094235.png](/img/user/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250903094235.png)
Read this: https://thejns.org/spine/view/journals/j-neurosurg-spine/23/6/article-p673.xml
All based on static X rays; however complex to communicate to other providers

Better classification is Han Jo Kim's recent 2022 classification:
![Pasted image 20250903094832.png](/img/user/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250903094832.png)
![Pasted image 20250903094653.png](/img/user/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250903094653.png)
Regarding group 1 deformities, the Kim classification identified a mainly cervicothoracic curve was secondary to significant CL-T1S mismatch. Treatment for group 1 flat-neck deformities is heterogenous in terms of anterior versus posterior approach however these deformities most often require fusions from **C2 to a high-thoracic lowest instrumented vertebrae (LIV).**

Regarding group 2 deformities, the main driver was identified as focal kyphosis between 2 cervical vertebrae with overall maintained global alignment secondary to compensatory increases in T1S (> 22°). These patients often require combined anterior/posterior approaches, with **shorter constructs confined to the cervical spine** [[10](https://www.e-neurospine.org/m/journal/view.php?number=1330#b10-ns-2245864-392)].
	With posterior facetectomy you get 5-10 degrees of additional lordosis at each level you perform

Regarding group 3 deformities, the main driver was identified as extremely large T1S (> 50°). "Head heavy and chin-on-chest deformities" Surgical treatment for these patients **most often requires an isolated posterior approach with an extended constructs extending to a LIV in the midthoracic to high-lumbar region.** These patients frequently require 3-column osteotomies for adequate deformity correction [[10](https://www.e-neurospine.org/m/journal/view.php?number=1330#b10-ns-2245864-392)].

The Kim classification has also shown high intraobserver reliability and is currently the only codified CSD classification system which both utilizes dynamic cervical spine imaging and guides treatment approaches [[10](https://www.e-neurospine.org/m/journal/view.php?number=1330#b10-ns-2245864-392),[39](https://www.e-neurospine.org/m/journal/view.php?number=1330#b39-ns-2245864-392)].


For Neurosurgery Boards you should at least be aware of 
1. Pelvic incidence
2. Pelvic tilt
3. Sacral Slope

### Before Deformity Surgery
ENT dysphagia evaluation documented
Medically optimize
Full-length X rays, standing films; if you don't have that then you stitch the x-rays together
Cervical flexion-extension X rays to classify and assess the deformity
CT and CTA for fusions between uncinate processes and assessment of VA (especially if you are going to be doing pedicle screws)
	HU < 120 has 85% chance of DJK
	Treat the osteoporosis
	Know where the vertebral artery is going, many vertebral artery anomalies
MRI for evaluation of neural elements, thecal sac continuity, soft tissue evaluation of Retropharyngeal space for anterior approaches

## Neurovascular Conference
Patient with pain and heaviness in the legs and arms, feels as if he has rocks in his shoes
Lost the ability to walk his 3 miles
Speech difficulties, Needs assistance to put his shoes on
AxOx4, face symmetric, tongue midline, equivocal hoffman's, no clonus, 5/5 muscles laying down, gait unsteady


Clumping of nerve roots can be seen on MRI
	Waviness and clumping can be seen above spinal canal compression (tumor or disc) and in arachnoiditis
Decided to get a full body MRI
CT Head - ICAD, normal areas of calcification in even in the basal gangia called Farras disease
T2WI - vascular flow voids dorsal to the cervical spinal cord, without intervening parenchyma
	Recall that AVMs have some sort of parenchymal component
Classification of spinal arteriovenous anomalies
![Pasted image 20250903103632.png](/img/user/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250903103632.png)

A type 1 dural AVF comes from the dorsal radicular artery, pierces the dura at the **nerve root sleeve**
![Pasted image 20250903110009.png](/img/user/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250903110009.png)

This patient had a type 1 dAVF at the thyrocervical trunk - the thyrocervical trunk contributes to the inferior thyroid artery

## Foix-Alajouanine syndrome 
is ==a progressive myelopathy caused by a spinal dural arteriovenous malformation (SDAVF), leading to symptoms like progressive weakness, walking problems, and sensory loss in the legs, along with early bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction==. The condition, which most commonly affects elderly men and the lower thoracic spinal region, is treated through procedures like endovascular embolization or surgical obliteration of the malformation.

## Blood supply to spinal cord
Anterior and posterior spinal arteries
Radicular arteries from the Aorta
2 types of hooks you can use in the spinal angiography
	Both Iliacs
	Median Sacral
	Cervical verts
	Cervical carotids
Sheppard's hook in Michaelson catheter
Also another stubby catheter called the Cobra
![Pasted image 20250903105232.png](/img/user/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250903105232.png)

![Pasted image 20250903105040.png](/img/user/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250903105040.png)
You cannot treat dAVFs at the level of the artery of Adamkiewicz endovascularly
	Embolizing an artery that supplies the Artery of Adamkiewicz (AKA) is contraindicated and must be avoided due to the high risk of catastrophic spinal cord ischemia, which can result in paraplegia. The AKA is the primary blood supply for the lower two-thirds of the spinal cord and inadvertently blocking its flow can lead to severe neurological damage.
Remember that prolonged venous transit time is indicative of venous hypertension and there must be a fistula somewhere

## Treatment
for lumbar and thoracic dAVF you can put coils and treat it endovascularly

This patient, you have to do an unsubtracted angiogram, get to C6 and do a laminectomy
Looking lateral where the nerve roots are going out, you will see a caliber change from a normal sized artery to an engorged vein
This is a nice case for ICG to see the early draining vein, before it should, upon disconnection you will then see venous phase drainage
Patient will be started on aspirin after the procedure
