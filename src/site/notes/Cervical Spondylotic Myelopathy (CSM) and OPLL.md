## Anatomy and Pathophysiology
Cord itself occupies 0.8-1.3 cm AP dimension
Absolute stenosis: < 10 mm AP diameter of cervical canal
	Patients present in 40s-50s
Relative stenosis: < 13 mm AP diameter
	Patients present later in their 50s-60s
## Symptoms:
Painless upper and lower extremity weakness, numbness, loss of balance, ataxic gait
Atrophy of thenar and hypothenar eminence
Stereoanesthesia: inability to recognzie objects by touch alone, while pain, temperature are intact
Useless hand syndrome
LE weakness tends to be **proximal**
Diffuse hyperreflexia (Bilateral Babinski responses)
## Myelopathy Classification Scales
**Nurick Classification**: Grades III-IV are candicates for cervical laminectomy
![Pasted image 20250806092322.png](/img/user/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250806092322.png)

**Ranawat Classification**: particularly for those with [[Spine/Rheumatoid Arthritis\|Rheumatoid Arthritis]] leading to [[Rheumatoid Cervical Myelopathy\|Rheumatoid Cervical Myelopathy]]

**Japanese Orthopedic Association Scale**

## OPLL as a cause of CSM
Most prevalent in Japanese, hence "japanese disease" and Middle Eastern Populations
Characterized by ectopic bone formation in the spinal ligaments, most commonly C3-4 to C6-7, gets thicker over time
In the C spine, M:F is 2:1, in T spine F>M
Patients present in the **6th** decade with symptoms
key chromosome is **6p**, **PLZF, CBFA1**: ischemia of the spinal cord
Encourage patients that they **cannot ignore this pathology**

>"Would you like to take care of this now, that you have mild symptoms and a mild risk of new arm paralysis or would you like to take care of this 10 years down the road, when you are older and sicker, and you have a significant risk of arm paralysis

Patients with canal stenosis >14mm may not have myelopathic symptoms, because their body is essentially autofusing itself to help itself out, that way there is no dynamic compression of the spinal cord
It has been noted that patients with a spinal canal smaller than 6 mm are likely to develop myelopathy, while those with a spinal canal greater than 14 mm are usually asymptomatic

## Workup
**Cervical Flexion Extension X-rays**: Flexion tenses the cord, narrows the cord AP diameter, Extension shortens and thickens the cord
	Laminectomy requires **At least 10 degrees of cervical lordosis** 
	Laminoplasty requires 10 degrees of cervical lordosis AND **Less than 7 degrees of ventral OPLL or spondylosis**
	**Frank instability** necessitating fusion is defined by:
	 >3.5mm of subluxation, >20 degrees of angulation, and over 1-2mm of motion between the tips of adjacent spinous processes
	Congenital Cervical Stenosis 
		The anterior margin of the facet joints overlap the interlaminar line
		The vertebral body in AP dimension cannot fit within the spinal canal
**MRI C Spine**
	Increased T2 signal within the cord indicates: **acute edema, demyelination or chronic myelomalacia**
**Obtain CT myelogram** if you suspect that the OPLL has invaded the dura, as you might have to do a large reconstruction
	"double mushroom sign" or "double layer sign" is indicative that the OPLL has invaded the dura

## Postoperative Management
Laminectomy: maintain Hard cervical collar for 6 weeks
Laminecotmy and fusion: cervicothoracic orthosis until CT demonstrates fusion
