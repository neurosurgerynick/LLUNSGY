#spine 

Associated with [[Pediatric Neurosurgery/Myelomeningocele\|Myelomeningocele]] and lipomyelomeningocele - the most serious form of [[spina bifida\|spina bifida]] which by definition presents with a [[Chiari Malformation\|Chiari Malformation]]
	1/3 of patients with [[Chiari Malformation\|Chiari Malformation]] will develop TCS
	1/3 of patients with TCS will become symptomatic

Also associated with dermal sinus tract and diastematomyelia (spinal cord split in 2 near the end)

Best visualized on the T1 sequence because you want to see fat.
CSF space looks dark on MRI T1
The cord will be tethered to a hyperintense T1 fat signal

### Symptoms result from vascular compromise from spinal cord stretching
- progressive orthopedic deformities (curled toes, high arches)
- back pain with activity 
- shooting pains down the back of the legs
- bowel or bladder dysfunction
- progressive sensorimotor deficits (weakness and numbness of the legs)
- scoliosis

### Imaging
MRI shows thickened filum terminale (fatty)

### Treated with Tethered Cord Release
- laminectomy
- incise the dura
- free intradural adhesions or fat
- patch the dura to prevent CSF leak
### Shortening procedure available for children with refractory TCS after initial management
