30 million spine operations are performed per year in the United States
Rates: 
	[[Spine/ACDF\|ACDF]] (0.1-1.6%), 0.09% in minimally invasive noninstrumented discectomies, 1.9% deep infections in open 1-level limited discectomy, 2.7% in aggressive discectomy
Most common organisms are staphylococcal (MRSA 17%, MSSA 41.9%)
3 presentations: diskitis, [[Osteomyelitis\|Osteomyelitis]], [[Spinal Epidural Abscess\|Spinal Epidural Abscess]]
## Risk Factors
- artificial hips/knees
- cardiac valves
- intra-operative contamination, reduce OR personnel, OR traffic, shift changes for scrub techs
- [[HIV positive status; Human Immunodeficiency Virus\|HIV positive status; Human Immunodeficiency Virus]]: S. Aureus 72%, TB next
- longer surgeries
- instrumentation use (better to not instrument in older patients if possible)
- morbid obesity BMI>35, uncontrolled [[T2DM\|T2DM]]
- Transfusions: 1.6% rate of infection 1-3 units, 3.6% rate of infection >3 units
## Workup
Assessment of source, important to treat these sites preoperatively
	Bowel surgery
	Infected Craniotomy
	UTI
	Pneumonia
obtain blood cultures
ESR and CRP
Diagnostic scans (positive timeframe): 
	Gallium (24h), Bone scan (1-2 weeks), MR+Gd (2-4 weeks), CT (6 weeks), XR (3-10 weeks) 

## Medical management (antibiotics)
>When is it appropriate?
	No significant neurologic deficit, no neurological deterioration/worsening
	ESR/CRP coming down
	No sepsis
	No radiographic worsening
- Antibiotics for 8-12 weeks (at least 6 weeks)
- PICC line insertion
- Hyperbaric oxygen
- Usage of enclosed rooms, no use of curtains
## Operative Intervention
>When is it appropriate?
	Increasing ESR/CRP OR persistently high ESR/CRP
	Significant Neurological Deficits, or Neurological worsening
	Active sepsis for source control
	Vertebral collapse leading to instability
- Wash with chlorhexidine sponge 24h before and morning of surgery
- Nutritional optimization
	- fewer infections in patients who have higher prealbumin levels >20mg/dL @salvettiJNSSpine2018
- Preoperative [[Cephalosporins\|Cephalosporins]] 2 gram dose given **15m before surgery**, NOT 30 minutes
	- Gentamycin given before surgery also decreases risk of MRSA infections, readily penetrates disc space
	- Vancomycin + Cefazolin decreases SSI rate for Instrumented spinal fusion (4% to 2%) @lopezSpine2019
- Avoid shaving
- Warming Blankets, Warm IV fluids, Lower body Bair Hugger
- Iodine drapes
- Change gloves q2h
- Change suction tips q2h
- Intraoperative irrigation with bacitracin/polymyxin B sulfate q15m with **pulsatile irrigation** AND 1L after the 
- Wound care
	- postoperative silver-impregnated dressings, reusable for 7 days and can be washed with sterile water
	- avoid long use of drains (5 days worse than 3.5 days in Pennington study)
- Use of drains but avoid prolonged maintenance
