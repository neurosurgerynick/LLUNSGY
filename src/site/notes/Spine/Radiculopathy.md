>Radiculopathy refers to the neurologic symptoms secondary to the compression of spinal nerve roots, which commonly results from a narrow or stenotic neural foramen, a herniated intervertebral disc, spondylolisthesis (displacement of a vertebra), or compression from extrinsic sources such as tumors. Heavy lifting is a risk factor for degenerative disc disease and disc herniation because of acute increases in intradiscal pressure, which can lead to narrowing of the neural foramina or herniation of the disc. Radiculopathy is common in the lumbosacral region. Pain, sensory deficits, and motor dysfunction typically occur in the dermatomal and myotomal distribution that correlates to the affected nerve root.

>Within the lumbosacral plexus, there is often significant combined contribution of innervation across dermatomes and myotomes, such that deficits typically associated with one vertebral level may overlap with adjacent levels.

## Lumbar radiculopathy 

#### L4
typically presents with weakness of knee extension and hip adduction and a diminished patellar reflex, along with pain and numbness of skin overlying the medial buttock, lateral thigh, medial leg, foot dorsum, and hallux, though deficits may appear to a lesser extent in territories also associated with L3 and L5 as anatomic variation exists.

Management of radiculopathy includes treatment of the underlying problem, analgesia if needed, and consideration of surgical correction in refractory cases or in patients with progressive or severe/impairing neurologic symptoms. Many symptoms resolve with conservative management with **anti-inflammatory and analgesic medications and physical therapy**.
