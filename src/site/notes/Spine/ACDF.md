## positioning
use a towel underneath the shoulders horizontally to get some lordosis
Tape under their chin so their head wont turn side to side
Use a marker to mark their adams apple and sternum and both clavicular heads
Mark out the medial border of the SCA

## incision
Use lateral fluoroscopy and their wrinkle lines and use that to hide the incision nicely 
	15 blade scalpel, horizontal because it's sensitive tissue
Make your horizontal incision past midline from medial border of sca
incise horizontally through the platysma innervated by CN VII
Identify the medial border of the SCM, stay medial
Keep the [[Carotid sheath\|Carotid sheath]] lateral to you
You will feel the peaks and the valleys
	Peaks are the discs
	Valleys are the midpoints of the "scalloped" borders of the anterior vertebral bodies
	Ask for handheld clauers to pull the trachea so you can expose midline
Use a bent spinal needle and insert into disc, peak, to localize at the correct level

_Some surgeons say that this disrupts the ALL, and can cause adjacent segment disease if used_

Elevate the longus coli with the bovie, or key elevator

Insert Caspar pins to distract the disc space

Extract the disc with pituitary under microscope
Use kerryson 2 to bite off the posterior osteophytes and last remnants of disc, get down to PLL whose fibers run north to south, or have assistant use 11 blade to get through, don't cut through the dura which runs just underneath

Extend laterally enough to see the uncovertebral joints and decompress the foramina

### Side effects/Complications:
Most common complication is **dysphagia**
	Counsel on stiff muscles
	Counsel on loss of motion, which is minimal in the subaxial spine
		For SOF, there will be no range of motion
		For C1,2 fusion, there is loss of rotation
		For Subaxial spine, there is maintenance of rotation, but minimal loss of flexion and extension
ENT sharply dissects down to C3-4 which helps reduce dysphagia 2/2 traction on the longissimus muscle - reducing damage to the superior laryngeal nerve

**Pain between the shoulder blades** is a common complaint, due to overdistraction, and some ligamentous injury from extending the neck with caspar pins

Going **posterior** as an aside,
Most common complication is wound dehiscence and infection
     Topical vancomycin powder reduces gram positive - MSSA and MRSA infections
     Contrary to ID beliefs, research does not support in meta analysis that vancomycin increases the gram negative infections
Best way to reduce wound dehiscence is by using slow-absorbing sutures for fascial closures
     Ethibond or PDS instead of Vicryl
