- DYE: as the attending on call, acute blood is an indication to wake them up and call. Attendings are expected to take call since they were 2nd year residents, their spouses wake up and that's what has to happen. Do not develop a culture as a junior resident where the risk is high. Do not make assumptions. 
	- When you get a consult, put a consult stopper into the note as a one-liner: Consult received, will go see the patient, CT reviewed and non-operative, patient requires transfer to the ICU, full note and recommendations to follow. 
	- Call the attending on the primary caring service, and call your attending
	- Document, do not trust secure chat, it is not legally binding
	- Recommendations must be delivered within the hour, even if its a brief note and not a full H&P
	- AND go further than that and call someone

## PEDS specifically
> you have to oversee everything that happens on the peds team
> do not trust that things are moving forward if you release your recommendations.
> Anything operative, potentially operative, or procedural, your attending needs to know
> Your seniors are your buffer, that you should notify prior to calling your attending. 
> In your notes, write down who you spoke to on the phone or on secure chat about each recommendation, add to the consult note with the initial recommendations
