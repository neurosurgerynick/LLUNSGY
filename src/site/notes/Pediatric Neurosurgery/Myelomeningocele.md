leads to herniation of the spinal cord from the dorsal defect
Detected by highly elevated [[alfa fetoprotein aFP\|alfa fetoprotein aFP]] in the amniotic fluid during screening
Elevated acetylcholinesterase in the amniotic fluid

Paralysis of the infant below the level of the defect

## Associations
[[Chiari Malformation\|Chiari Malformation]] Type II
[[Spine/Tethered Cord Syndrome\|Tethered Cord Syndrome]]

## Morbidity
1. VP Shunt malfunction 
	1. To avoid a lifetime of shunt, an [[ETV; endoscopic third ventriculostomy\|ETV; endoscopic third ventriculostomy]] can be performed with choroid plexus cauterization to stop the development of [[Hydrocephalus\|Hydrocephalus]]
	2. Shunt malfunctions must be fixed prior to correction (decompression) of a CM-II 
2. Recurrent UTI

## Management
1. prophylactic antibiotics
2. ETV or VP shunt within 24-48 hours
3. CM-II Decompression
