## M&M Conference

- [[Neurotrauma/Subdural hematoma; SDH\|Subdural hematoma; SDH]]
- Did not meet operative criteria
- acute on chronic worsening of a chronic SDH 2/2 low platelets, platelets not transfused by medicine team
- Medicine accused NSGY for not releasing recommendations, because the note was not timely, secure chat messages were not protective
- Based off non-operative criteria, the decision was made not to operate
	- q1h neurochecks
	- seizure ppx
	- transfuse platelets to correct coagulopathy
- Lessons: secure chat should have been documented in the note, do not assume that platelets are transfused and keep a close eye on patient that could likely become operative, place the order yourself. Medicine attending did not receive information about the platelets. 
- DYE: as the attending on call, acute blood is an indication to wake them up and call. Attendings are expected to take call since they were 2nd year residents, their spouses wake up and that's what has to happen. Do not develop a culture as a junior resident where the risk is high. Do not make assumptions. 
	- When you get a consult, put a consult stopper into the note as a one-liner: Consult received, will go see the patient, CT reviewed and non-operative, patient requires transfer to the ICU, full note and recommendations to follow. 
	- Call the attending
	- Document, do not trust secure chat, it is not legally binding
	- Recommendations must be delivered within the hour, even if its a brief note and not a full H&P
	- AND go further than that and call someone
		- If there is something obviously non-operative and not dangerous like a TP fracture then you don't need to 
- [[how to handle a consult\|how to handle a consult]]
