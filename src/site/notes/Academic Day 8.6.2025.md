## Subependymal Gray Matter Heterotopia as a cause of Epilepsy
- "Candle guttering" was a term used in old textbooks to refer to the morphology of subependymal heterotopic gray matter. 
- Appears as small nodules of gray matter underneath the ependymal surface, around the ventricle
- ![[Pasted image 20250806084228.png \| 250]]
- Heterotopic gray matter is highly epileptogenic
- More common in **females**, there is some **X-linked** component
- More frequently seen in [[Tuberous Sclerosis Complex\|Tuberous Sclerosis Complex]]
- Example of a woman with severe convulsive seizures, which significantly increases risk for SUDEP
	- Evaluated with SEEG to attempt to map the focus of the seizures, demonstrated no focal lesions in the temporal lobes
	- RNS device, 2 electrodes a depth and a surface or any mix of the two, although deep occipital subependymal nodules
		- Note that for bitemporal epilepsy, you will place 2 depth electrodes because you need control of both foci
	- Then she developed drop attacks, these seizures stop very well with corpus callosotomy

## Raney Clips during Closure
Remove 1 pair of raney clips at a time
the rule is 1 raney clip = 1 galeal suture
Closure of the galea is in itself hemostatic
If anything is actively pumping you can use the bipolar, but oozing is good for wound healing

## Neurogenic Claudication
Pain in the legs, worsened by exertion
Leaning forward when walking uphill, is the shopping cart sign

> Anterolisthesis vs. Spondylolisthesis vs. Spondylosis
> spondylosis implies that there is narrowing of the spinal canal

## OPLL; ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament
Often called the Japanese disease due to prevalence
	Also middle easterns
Ectopic bone formation in the spinal ligaments, most commonly C3-4 to C6-7, gets thicker over time
In the C spine, M:F is 2:1, in T spine F>M
Patients present in the **6th** decade with symptoms
key chromosome is **6p**, **PLZF, CBFA1**: ischemia of the spinal cord
	neck pain
	dysethesias
	weakness
	clumsiness of the hands
	spasticity
	Ataxic gait
Encourage patients that they cannot ignore this pathology
	Would you like to take care of this now, that you have mild symptoms and a mild risk of new arm paralysis
	or would you like to take care of this 10 years down the road, when you are older and sicker, and you have a significant risk of arm paralysis
Patients with canal stenosis >14mm may not have myelopathic symptoms, because their body is essentially autofusing itself to help itself out, that way there is no dynamic compression of the spinal cord
It has been noted that patients with a spinal canal smaller than 6 mm are likely to develop myelopathy, while those with a spinal canal greater than 14 mm are usually asymptomatic

## Workup
Get a CT myelogram if you suspect that the OPLL has invaded the dura, as you might have to do a large reconstruction
the "double mushroom sign" or "double layer sign" is indicative that the OPLL has invaded the dura

## Treatments
Fusion WITHOUT decompression - indicated for patients with dynamic myelopathy only
Anterior corpectomy - indicated for the patient with a kyphotic deformity
Laminoplasty - indicated for cervical only OPLL due to the lordosis, the spinal cord drifts backwards. Lower rate of kyphotic deformity 8% when compared to laminectomy 45% due to maintenance of the posterior tension band
## Anterior corpectomy steps
>80% of the risk is the exposure, if this person has a really fat neck, the anterior approach will be very complicated and you should go with the suboptimal approach
Patient factors will make you choose the safer approach for the patient. Esophageal injuries are more common when ENT does the exposure in personal experience

ACDF exposure, anterior to SCM, retract carotid and longissimus laterally
in the plane between the carotid sheath lateral and 
conventional discektomy at all levels
