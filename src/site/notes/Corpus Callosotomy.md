#Epilepsy

> Victor Horsley was the first to describe a subpial dissection
### Indications:
- drop attacks
- frequent convuslive seizures in patients with [[convulsive status epilepticus\|convulsive status epilepticus]]
	- Transforms these seizures into more minor and less dangerous seizure times
### Technical considerations:
- interhemispheric transcallosal, 

**Positioning:**
- supine in children
	- has the advantage of left/right orientation 
- Lateral, left side up and right side down, the falx retracts the left hemisphere for you and gravity is retracting the right side down toward the floor, with right-sided frontal craniotomy anterior to the precentral sulcus to avoid the anastomotic vein of Trolard 
**Approach**
- Stay in the midline, as a young neurosurgeon, you want frequent use of navigation to ensure that you are not veering off midline or going too far (especially with rostral dissection)
- Use the sonopet at the lowest settings to separate the white matter, anterior to posterior, try to get as close as possible to the splenium. 
- Anteriorly, you want to take the rostrum, which goes straight down near the orbits
### Anatomy
- Left and right cingulate gyri, can be stuck together and can be a challenge (birth trauma or meningitic scarring) and sulcus lie above the corpus callosum
- left and right pericallosal arteries from the ACA will be in your field, you want to be between these vessels. 
	- they send perforating vessels into their respective hemispheres thus you want to keep them on their own sides
- Generally you want to preserve the ependyma which looks blue
### Goal:
anterior 2/3rds of the corpus callosum in adults
in children you may often get the entire corpus callosum
