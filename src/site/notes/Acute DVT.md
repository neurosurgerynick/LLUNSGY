![Pasted image 20240608223848.png](/img/user/assets/Pasted%20image%2020240608223848.png)
 It's performed by having the patient flex their knee and then forcibly dorsiflex their foot. If the patient experiences pain behind the knee or in their calf muscles, it's considered a positive Homans' sign

## Poor prognostic factors: increased mortality
Risk factors for in-hospital mortality include the presence of obstructive shock and advanced age.
## Treatment and prophylaxis
- subcutaneous [[LMW Heparin; LMWH\|LMW Heparin; LMWH]] (enoxaparin; lovenox)
	- beware of [[HIT; Heparin induced thrombocytopenia\|HIT; Heparin induced thrombocytopenia]]
	Low-molecular-weight heparin therapy is the most appropriate perioperative measure to prevent deep venous thrombosis (DVT). DVT, the presence of a blood clot within a deep vein of the upper or lower extremities,is a common complication during inpatient admissions and in the perioperative setting. The formation of a DVT is promoted by the presence of features of Virchow triad: venous stasis (e.g., immobility, venous occlusion), endothelial injury (e.g., infection, trauma, inflammation, cannulation), and hypercoagulability (e.g., perioperative state, malignancy, genetic or acquired thrombophilia). A patient with a history of malignancy, surgery, and immobility is at a substantially increased risk for the development of a DVT. Modifiable actions to reduce the incidence of DVT during admission include minimizing immobility with early postsurgical ambulation and use of a prophylactic anticoagulant, such as subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin, when deemed appropriate.
