## Pathophysiology of Addison's Hyponatremia
> Adrenal glands are unable to produce mineralocorticoids (aldosterone) as the end effector hormone of the RAAS system
> Renal losses of sodium and water
> Hypovolemia causes the posterior pituitary to produce ADH
> Free water resorption, leading to high urine sodium >20 mEq/L
> Uosm is greater than the serum osm

Defined by:
	Low 8 AM serum (basal) cortisol and physiologic high plasma ACTH
	No response to the Cosyntropin (250 micrograms of synthetic ACTH) simulation test as the adrenal glands are hypofunctional
