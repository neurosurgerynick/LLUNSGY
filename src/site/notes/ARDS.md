The most common mechanism of VQ mismatch in ARDS is **shunt** whereby the alveoli are filled with gunk, blood does not get oxygenated as it is shunted away from oxygenated areas
The alveoli are filled with ==fibrinous proteinaceous fluid== and the blood does not get oxygenated leading to hypoxemia with a low PaO2
