## Evaluation
- check the platelets and the INR to asess for progression
- check to see if it meets operative criteria
# Acute
Hematoma formation 2/2 the shearing of briding veins which drain the surface of the brain into the dural venous sinuses, more commonly in elderly and alcoholics due to the elongation of the bridging veins from loss of cerebral volume
## Treatment
Craniotomy

# Chronic (CSDH)

Hematoma formation resulting from the shearing of the dural **border cells** located between the meningeal [[dura\|dura]] and the arachnoid mater leading to 1) fibrin deposition, 2) liquefaction of the acute blood, and 3) the formation of a highly vascular, collagenous outer neomembrane and bleeding sourced from the **middle meningeal artery** 
Imaging will be: Laminar/Bridging/Trabeculated/homogenously hypodense (when r/o acute hygroma)
This neomembrane can be seen on CT as a laminar appearance, a hyperdense line along the inner surface of the dural collection
## CT classification

## DDx
[[Subdural Hygroma\|Subdural Hygroma]]
## Treatment
First Line:
- Reverse anticoagulation [[warfarin\|warfarin]] with [[FFP; fresh frozen plasma\|FFP; fresh frozen plasma]] or [[PCC; prothrombin complex concentrate\|PCC; prothrombin complex concentrate]]
- Preoperative antiepileptic drugs to prevent postoperative seizure
- Burrhole Craniostomy
	- Subperiosteal drains (subgaleal drains) are better for reducing infection, recurrence, and misplacement than subdural drains
	- ![Pasted image 20240530163515.png](/img/user/Neurotrauma/assets/Pasted%20image%2020240530163515.png)
- Twist drill Craniostomy with hollow screws decreases length of stay
- +/- MMA embolization with polyvinyl alcohol to prevent recurrence



- CT postoperative, but not superior to CT only done for new neurodeficits
	NCT01624545
> Hx of Atrial Fibrillation
- Resume antiplatelet medications
- Resume anticoagulation only if there is benefit comparing [[CHA2DS2 VASc\|CHA2DS2 VASc]] vs. [[HAS-BLED\|HAS-BLED]] score


Craniotomy is no longer widely used for chronic subdural due to 30% mortality rate, only used for CSDH that is unable to be evacuated through burr hole. 
	Craniotomy is indicated if there is a significant *acute component*
	Or if there is a *significantly loculated hematoma* making craniostomy not effective
## Postoperative Risks
acute postoperative ICH
seizures
