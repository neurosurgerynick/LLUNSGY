# Sign-out tips

- A computerized sign-out system may be available in the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) to facilitate managing the patient list
- If not signing out through the EMR, provide a printed, updated copy of your patient list to the on-call or night float
- If you sign out a patient who is being discharged, **complete all relevant paperwork yourself**
- Sign out is not the ideal time to discuss patients in detail from a learning perspective. If you see a potential learning case at sign out, follow up on your own time later.
## The Written Sign-out:

- Provide a **complete list** of the patients on your service
- Ensure that each patient’s name, Medical Record Number (MRN), admit date, room number, attending, and code status are accurately recorded on the sign-out sheet.
- **Contact information for the Power of Attorney** should be provided for patients with **altered mental status**, particularly if they are **unstable**
- Sign out sheet should also contain brief versions of the following: **reason for admission, past medical history, key medications, and clinical course**. Doses of key medications and allergies should be provided if EHR is unavailable at your site.
- A “to do” list for the on-call resident should also be included.  
    - **Highlight any laboratory or radiology results that must be followed overnight**
        - Provide contingency plan. For instance, instead of signing out “Follow hemoglobin”, sign out “If hemoglobin is less than 7 g/dL, administer 1-unit PRBC”
    - **Highlight any orders/interventions that must be written or carried out overnight**
- If there are restrictions on who can receive information about the patient, highlight this on the signout
## The Verbal Sign-out

- For each patient, provide a brief succinct verbal description of reason for admission, active medical problems and relevant history.  Most patients can be described within 1-2 minutes.
- Highlight unstable patients and dedicate greater time to describing them, including code status and follow up items. Provide verbal contingency plans for “to-do” list, in addition to listing them on the sign out, as discussed in the “written sign-out” above.
- Discuss the code status for unstable patients, and cover pre cardiac arrest situations including intubation for impending respiratory failure and use of cardioversion for unstable rhythms. If an unstable patient is Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) status, clarify if non-invasive ventilation and ICU transfer for vasopressors or other reasons is acceptable.
- Discuss POA information for unstable patients to ensure understanding and accuracy
- Share any specific medical and social concerns regarding a given patient with the night float and provide specific recommendations
