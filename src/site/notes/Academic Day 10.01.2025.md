# Presurgical conference
## [[Corpus Callosotomy\|Corpus Callosotomy]]
for a patient with drop attacks
## Right frontal tumor
CT scan: mass effect, calcifications and 10mm of midline shift
CTA: mass effect and deviation of the ACAs from the right to the left, no evidence of significant erosion or narrowing
Operative considerations: navigation and/or **intraoperative pencil doppler ultrasound**
Symtpoms of leg weakness, due to ACA compression, from subfalcine herniation: [[Brain herniation syndromes\|Brain herniation syndromes]]

## Paraspinal tumor
Neurofibroma vs. Lipoma vs. other
Prone, paraspinal incision centered over the tumor
	you want to take the best approach for the problem in front of you, do not go midline in this case in anticipation of future surgery because generally you need to treat the problem the best way for the patient
Send frozens during the case to ensure that you don't need to take wide margins

## CT brain
- sulcal subarachnoid hemorrhage
- right temporal pole hemorrhage 
- large communicating segment ICA aneurysm 
- [[Cerebrovascular/Fetal PCA\|Fetal PCA]] on angiogram
- The aneurysm has residual contrast enhancement
- [[Cerebrovascular/Aneurysm Clipping\|Aneurysm Clipping]]
