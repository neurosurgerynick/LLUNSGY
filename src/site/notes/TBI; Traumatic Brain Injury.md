> Know that there exists:
	Trauma Transfer Report
	TBI orderset

Maintain the Goldilock's principle:
	Normal temp (98-99.5)
	Normal oxygen and paO2 (100-200)
	Normal co2 (35-40)
	Normal glucose (140-180)
	Normal BP, use nicardipine because reversible (120-160)
	NORMAL SODIUM 145-155 if increased icp; 140-145 if no suspected increased ICP
	Normal ICP HOB 30-45, sedation

TXA should be given based on the RHOTEM elastic study per the CRASH trial

Antiepileptic, keppra 7 days
Beta blocker, propanolol centrally active decreased 30 day mortality. (No mechanism available/ likely prevents sympathetic storming)
- 1st line propanolol
- 2nd line: large dose morphine 4-8 breaks sympathetic storming 
- clonidine has more complications
- Bromocriptine 4th line
- dark room, no music, let brain recover, turn the room into a cave
Early enteral nutrition, no reason they should not feed
Chemical DVT prophylaxis
Q1h neurochecks

## Critical neuroworsening
Stroke- post-traumatic cerebral ischemia
Cerebral edema from [[SIADH\|SIADH]]
Electrolytes
Substance Withdrawal (25% meth at LLU)
Hypoglycemia


## Complications
 [[ARDS\|ARDS]]
Aki from high chloride from ns - switch to balanced solution early
## Adrenal Insufficiency
increased renin and decreased or inappropriately normal concentration of aldosterone, are suggestive of adrenal insufficiency. Common causes of
adrenal insufficiency include autoimmune adrenalitis, infections (tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, HIV, Waterhouse-Friedrichsen syndrome with Neisseria meningitidis
infection), malignancy, exogenous steroid use, and traumatic brain injury.
