Diagnosed by fasting serum glucose > 126 mg/dL
Random Glucose >200 mg/dL
or a [[HbA1c\|HbA1c]] > 6.5%
- ideally you need 2 positive tests

If the patient has [[PCOS\|PCOS]] they need a 3 hour OGTT

Not concerning if the HbA1c is 7.0-7.9%, that's considered *controlled* and we are not concerned about glycemic control -> this is the goal for surgery
If they are trying to get at problems with HbA1c it will be in the 9s or above

Common cause of immunocompromise, increasing the incidence of candidal fungal infections

### Diabetic Neuropathy
Nortriptyline, a [[tricyclic antidepressants\|tricyclic antidepressants]] medication, is the best alternative therapy for this patient with diabetic neuropathy that is refractory to **gabapentin and carbamazepine**. Diabetic neuropathy typically develops in patients with long-standing and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. The location of neuropathy tends to be in a stocking-glove distribution and gradually ascends from the feet to more proximal portions of the leg. Symptoms can range from the loss of sensation to dysesthesia. Early detection is essential as improved glycemic control can halt or slow the progression of the disease. Testing is completed in an ambulatory setting with the use of a
monofilament applied with light pressure to five separate points on the plantar surface of the foot. Loss of the ability to detect one or more of these pressure points should prompt further evaluation and tighter glycemic control. First-line treatment for painful neuropathy includes gabapentin, as it is generally well tolerated, but some patients may require additional or alternative medications for refractory symptoms. In conjunction with the treatment of neuropathy, patients should undergo frequent foot examinations to detect any ulcers, cuts, or fungal growth that may predispose to a diabetic foot infection.
### Diabetic Nephropathy
> Long-standing hyperglycemia such as that in diabetes mellitus can result in diabetic nephropathy. The pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy involves nonenzymatic glycosylation of the glomerular basement membrane and efferent arterioles. This results in thickening of the basement membrane along with compromise of the filtration barrier, which leads to an increased permeability to solutes and proteins. Mesangial expansion of the efferent arteriole also occurs, which can initially increase the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Diabetic nephropathy characteristically presents with eosinophilic nodular glomerulosclerosis, also known as Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules, on light microscopy if a biopsy is taken. The combination of increased basement membrane permeability and initially increased GFR progresses over time in patients with diabetes mellitus, beginning as microalbuminuria, progressing to macroalbuminuria (as seen in this case), and eventually to end-stage renal disease. Diabetic renal disease is the most likely mechanism for the patient's increased blood pressure related to associated increased extracellular volume along with increased reninangiotensin-aldosterone system activation.

### Bladder problems
- [[Overflow incontinence\|Overflow incontinence]]
- poorly controlled T2DM can cause diabetic bladder dysfunction (DSD) also called Diabetic cystitis
	- high post void residual volume
	- weak contractile ability of the detrusor muscle 2/2 non-enzymatic glycosylation of the [[pelvic nerve\|pelvic nerve]] which sends efferent parasympathetic action to induce micturition

### Statin requirements
Any male >40 with T2DM needs a statin, see [[Statin Therapy\|Statin Therapy]]

### [[Osteomyelitis\|Osteomyelitis]]
X-rays of the foot are the most appropriate next step in diagnosis of this patient. The patient has poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and is presenting with signs of
sepsis including fever, tachycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, and anion gap metabolic acidosis. Examination of the foot demonstrates a deep ulcer several centimeters in
diameter with areas of fibrinous slough and possible tendon or bone exposure. The ulcer may be the source of infection causing his systemic illness. A combination of
factors leads to increased risk for foot infections in diabetic patients. These include immune compromise inherent to diabetes, decreased sensation in the feet allowing
deep wounds to go undetected by patients, decreased motor function leading to altered pressure points and swelling of the lower extremities, and decreased autonomic
nervous system function leading to impaired sweat regulation and increased risk for dryness, cracking, and fissuring on the feet causing portals for bacterial entry. When a
diabetic foot ulcer is present, x-rays of the foot will help to evaluate for the presence of osteomyelitis and gas in the soft tissue, either of which could require surgical
management and will dictate the treatment plan for this patient. Most diabetic patients with osteomyelitis do not respond to medical management alone and often benefit
from surgical resection, generally amputation.
