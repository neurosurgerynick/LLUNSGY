# **Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccine**

##### **Summary of Recommendations**

###### _For Vaccination_

- Administer two doses of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) at least 1 month apart to people with a CD4 count ≥200 cells/mm3 and who have no evidence of immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella (evidence of immunity is defined as: patient was born before 1957, and/or had documentation of receipt of MMR, and/or has laboratory evidence of immunity or disease) **(AIII).**
- The MMR vaccine **is contraindicated** during pregnancy.
- People of childbearing potential who get the MMR vaccine should wait 4 weeks before getting pregnant.
- For pregnant people without immunity to rubella, **delay immunization until after pregnancy,** and then administer two doses of the MMR vaccine at least 1 month apart if the CD4 count is ≥200 cells/mm3 **(AIII).**
- If no serologic evidence of immunity exists after two doses of MMR vaccine, consider repeating the two-dose MMR series, especially if the person is vaccinated while not virologically suppressed **(CIII).**
- **Do not administer** MMR vaccine to people with HIV with CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 **(AIII).**

###### _For Post-exposure Prophylaxis_

- For measles exposure of non-immune individuals with CD4 count >200 cells/mm3, administer the MMR vaccine within 72 hours of exposure **or** immunoglobulin (IG) within 6 days of exposure. Do not administer the MMR vaccine and IG simultaneously.
- For measles exposure of non-immune individuals with CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 or those who are pregnant, administer IG within 6 days of exposure.

##### **Evidence Summary**

Measles is a highly contagious and potentially life-threatening disease. Measles is particularly virulent in the immunocompromised host, with a reported mortality rate as high as 40% in people with advanced HIV.40 Recently, measles outbreaks have occurred across the United States. From January 1 to October 3, 2019, 1,250 individual cases of measles were confirmed in 31 states, the most cases in 25 years. Current information regarding outbreaks can be found on the CDC website [Measles Cases and Outbreaks](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html).

With a resurgence of measles both domestically41 and globally,42 people with HIV should be assessed for immunity. Acceptable evidence of immunity includes being born before 1957, documented evidence of two doses of the MMR vaccine, or presence of positive antibody titers.

Individuals who do not fulfill any criteria for immunity and have CD4 count ≥200 cells/mm3 should receive two doses of MMR separated by at least 28 days. The combination measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine has not been studied in immunocompromised hosts and should **not** **be administered** to people with HIV.

Several studies from the 1990s found that 90% to 95% of adults with HIV were immune to measles.43-45 In these studies, serostatus did not vary by CD4 count, suggesting that people with HIV retained protective immunity even in the context of advanced disease. However, in a more recent study, the measles seroprevalence rate was 70.3%.46 Similarly, people with HIV appear to retain immunity to mumps and rubella even after acquisition of HIV.46

The MMR vaccine **is contraindicated** for people with HIV with CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 because the MMR vaccine is a live attenuated formulation that has been linked to fatal cases of measles‑associated pneumonitis following administration to people with HIV with a low CD4 count.47,48 For people with HIV with CD4 count ≥200 cells/mm3, the vaccine has been shown to be safe, although antibody response may be lower than for patients without HIV.46,49,50
