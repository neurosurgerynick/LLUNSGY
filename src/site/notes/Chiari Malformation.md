## Definition
Broadly any malformation of the posterior fossa that leads to cerebellar tonsil herniation and disruption of CSF flow across the foramen magnum
By definition a syrinx in the setting of Chiari is symptomatic

# symptoms
- headache while laughing
- Headache after crying
- Headache whilst singing songs
- symptomatic sleep apnea (central)
- In autistic children, this is hard to pars out as headbanging and self-stimulating behavior 

# examination
examine for evidence of neural tube defects (hair on the back) -> in that case do a lumbar MRI on a child
## Types
I: Descent of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum, and most common cause of [[syringomyelia\|syringomyelia]]
1.5: Herniation of the tonsils and the caudal descent of the brainstem
![[Chiari 1.5.png \| 300]]
II: by definition associated with spina bifida and [[Pediatric Neurosurgery/Myelomeningocele\|Myelomeningocele]]
	Headache with laughing, if weak/pain in the legs, in a Chiari II malformation patient, suspect
	[[Spine/Tethered Cord Syndrome\|Tethered Cord Syndrome]]
III/IV: complete herniation of the cerebellum outside of the skull, a true malformation

## imaging
- evaluate with MRI C Spine. Best sequence is T2 sagittal view, allows you to see syrinx
- MRI brain for hydrocephalus, however this is not the best study because of flow artifact on T2
- MRI thoracic and lumbar, especially for an adult, make sure to evaluate for a tethered cord
- McCraes line from basion to opisthion, >5mm herniation is considered a chiari
- Pb-c2 line. Drop a line from tip of basion to posterior corner of c2 body, 9mm of retroflexion of the odontoid tip = ventral brainstem compression= more complications with chiari surgery and need for OC fusion

Syrinx can occur anywhere, you can see it in the thoracic spine, 
## Treatment

High quality evidence you should not wait to operate, peds nsgy consortium study shows operating earlier has better outcomes

consent every patient for a c1 laminectomy
In young children, the c1 may be cartilaginous as its becoming ossified
### pinning
#### pediatrics
- you can pin a child when they have an inner and outer table of cortical bone on CT
- DO NOT USE PEDIATRIC PINS UNLESS ITS A TODDLER, the base causes a scalp pressure ulcer
	- if the bone is corticated, you can use adult pins, if not you would want to use pediatric pins
	- tip to flange distance is shorter; if you fracture the bone, its a depth stop
		- if you fracture the skull, it usually heals fine without intervention
		- can necrose the scalp on pediatric patients
	- shallower angle than adult pins
	- no more than 40lbs of pressure
Young children have a large occipital sinus, runs from torcula inferiorly in the midline to the circular sinus around the foramen magnum
	avoid duraplasty as blood loss can be quite significant

## Procedure
- 2cm x 2cm suboccipital craniotomy
- cut dura over each cerebellar hemisphere

### Peds
Often no need to open the dura
	C1 laminectomy and shaving off opisthion often enough
	almost all pediatrics patients get kyphosis postoperatively
If decided to open, Open the dura in a Y, stop in the midline
- Take a 4-0 neurolon and pass it under the sinus to tie it off preemptively and ligate
### adults
Mobilize the tonsils, if you resect them it can cause inflammatory reaction and arachnoid adhesions
If the tonsils are large, you can coagulate the pia to shrink them, but this causes infarction and swelling a few days later so do this sparingly. Patients will have a rocky 3-4 day hospital course, nausea.

	Tx this with a mesh cranioplasty
Targeted dural opening
Patch duraplasty

## Follow up
reimage with MRI in 1 year
