## Origin
attributed to Hippocrates originally
CSF is all produced by the choroid plexus
Presents differently in different age groups
Implies that the ICP is **elevated** as opposed to [[ventriculomegaly\|ventriculomegaly]] in which the ventricles are enlarged
### Early Efforts at shunting
Heroic measures were tried by Scarff and Dandy the former who tried transbasal translamina terminalis fenestration of the third ventricle
Dandy described in 1918 a plexectomy; the choroid plexus coagulation improved post infectious hydrocephalus [[ETV; endoscopic third ventriculostomy\|ETV; endoscopic third ventriculostomy]]

## Modern Access points
Rapid access into the ventricle when the cranium is exposed, you are looking at swollen brain so getting intraventricular is challenging
A posterior approach should ideally get into the atrium of the lateral ventricle
	some combination of Keen's point, Frazier's point, and dandy's point
### Silastic tubing
Developed in WWII as a silicon polymear used to seal electrical equipment in military aircraft
### First Commercial valves
Ball valve technology called the Spitz valve, Dr. spitz inserted these in the 1950s and you may still see them out in the public from patients who have been operated on at the Children's hospital of Philadelphia
John Holter was a machinist who developed a valve to save his son's life who suffered from hydrocephalus associated with a myelomeningocele
	The Holter valve is a slit valve technology whereby a slit controls the flow of CSF
1956: Robert Pudenz at the Hunitingon Medical Research INstitute developed in Pasadena where it is a combination of a slit and a sleeve 
	Particularly useful in powerful uni-direcitonal flow between the atrium of the heart and the brain
Solomon Hakim: PHD work in Boston, originally from Lebanon; he brought a group of patients to adams fisher and sweet in patients who had occult hydrocephalus with noramal ICP first describing [[Normal Pressure hydrocephalus; NPH\|Normal Pressure hydrocephalus; NPH]]
	the Hakim valve is still available today, there is a spring and a red ball which controls pressure and was adjustable
Codman Hakim valve costs $650 dollars however Benjamin Wharf published a paper where he described that the chabra valve worked equally as good and costed $35 dollars

## Communicating hydrocephalus
Thought to originate from a blockage of the arachnoid granulations

## Non-communicating hydrocephalus
- blockage is somewhere along the CSF pathway

## Monro-Kelly doctrine
3 brain compartments: blood, parenchyma, CSF

## Hydrocephalus in children
Defined as: 
	Rapid increase in head size
	Head size >95%ile for age
	increased size of ventricles on serial head ultrasounds

[[Levine Ventricular Index\|Levine Ventricular Index]] can be used to estimate the ability for surgical intervention of the ventricles in premature infants

if caused by alzheimers called [[hydrocephalus ex vacuo\|hydrocephalus ex vacuo]]
