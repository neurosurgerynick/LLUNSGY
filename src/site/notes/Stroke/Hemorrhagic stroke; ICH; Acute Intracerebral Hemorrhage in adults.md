## Common Locations of ICH
Top 5 locations: 
Basal Ganglia is most common ([[PLIC; posterior limb of internal capsule\|PLIC; posterior limb of internal capsule]] and the globus pallidus/putamen area are associated with worse odds of disability)[^1]
Lobar
Thalamus - worst prognosis on mRS scores at 1 and 6 months
Pons
Cerebellum

If in the occipito-parietal lobes suspect [[cerebral amyloid angiopathy\|cerebral amyloid angiopathy]]

## Treatment
- blood pressure lowering with IV nicardipine starting at 5mg/hr, increase by 2.5mg/hr every 15 minutes to maximum 15mg/hr to target blood pressuer goal of 140-179
	- [[ATACH-2 Trial\|ATACH-2 Trial]] showed no benefit on mRS when trying to reduce BP aggressively
	- [[Interact-2 Trial\|Interact-2 Trial]] Showed no benefit on the perihematomal edema at 72 hours after aggressive BP control, but a measured benefit on the size of the hematoma itself
	- [[CLEAR IVH Trial\|CLEAR IVH Trial]]
	- [[MISTIE 3\|MISTIE 3]]
