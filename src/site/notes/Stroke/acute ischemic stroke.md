#stroke 
## Initial managment

Patients may be eligible for **mechanical thrombectomy** (ie, catheter-assisted mechanical retrieval of a thrombus) if they meet the following criteria:

- Disabling neurologic symptoms
- Symptom **onset <24 hours**
- CT scan of the head consistent with an acute ischemic stroke (ie, no evidence of hemorrhage)
- **Large vessel occlusion** (eg, middle cerebral artery) demonstrated on CT angiography

Eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy is **independent of intravenous thrombolysis eligibility**.Â  Thrombectomy may be used in patients who undergo reperfusion therapy (ie, intravenous thrombolysis) as well as those who are ineligible for thrombolysis (eg, outside the appropriate time frame).

## Nicardipine
If the patient is a candidate for [[tPA; Tissue plasminogen activatior\|tPA; Tissue plasminogen activatior]], administer Nicardipine if the blood pressure is >185/110 before thrombolysis

If the patient is not a candidate for tPA, proceed directly to CT angiography of the head and neck to determine if eligible for mechanical thrombectomy (permissive hypertension)

If the patient however, has extremely high blood pressure 220/120, then administer Nicardipine as this patient is at risk for malignant hypertension resulting in end organ damage
