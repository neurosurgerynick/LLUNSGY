# Primary vs. Secondary
![Pasted image 20240520192621.png](/img/user/assets/Pasted%20image%2020240520192621.png)

## Primary 
- [[Addison's Disease, Primary Adrenal Insufficiency, PAI\|Addison's Disease, Primary Adrenal Insufficiency, PAI]]
- most commonly due to autoimmune adrenalitis, or [[Pulmonary tuberculosis; TB\|Pulmonary tuberculosis; TB]]
- because the problem is in the entire adrenal cortex, this affects glomerulosa, fasciculata, and reticularis layers
- insufficient mineralocorticoids (hyperkalemia), glucocorticoids, and androgens
## Secondary
- less severe symptoms as the **RAAS system regulates the production of (aldosterone) mineralocorticoids**, the **pituitary does not regulate aldosterone**'
