Very important that you DO NOT DO ON PATIENTS WITH DYSTONIA!!!
Spasticity is a hyperactive stretch reflex, so if you disconnect the afferent limb of the stretch reflex, you can diminish the spasticity
Important to only cut the sensory nerve rootlets
Important to avoid any innervation to the anal sphincter

Most patients toe walk before surgery, their motor pathways have developed the ability to walk by using their spasticity to their advantage, they have incorporated the natural hypertonicity into their gait, they are not used to volitionally contracting their muscles
## Risks
loss of sphincter control
	you would be astonished how many nerves go to your anal sphincter (sometimes 50% of your cauda equina)
Post-laminectomy deformity
Inability to walk after the procedure is expected as above

## Special Considerations
Pre-Op MRI to determine the level of the conus
Intraoperative US to determine the level of the conus
Physical Therapy assessment to determine which motor groups to target


Historically done freehand, Identify the conus, and determine which nerve rootlets are ventral and dorsal


## Procedure
Nowadays, - Bales J Pediatric Nerosurg 2016
Infralaminar, go at the laminar interspace, and perform a laminotomy (less risk of spinal deformity) or a hemilaminectomy right below the level of the conus
Establish the motor threshold typically 0.4mA or 0.5mA, sequentially stimulate all nerve roots, sensory roots will produce muscle contractions much higher at 0.8-1mA
Run a train of 50Hz stimulation and you will get a tetanic response, with crossover to the other limb, and identify most responsible nerves
Cut approximately 25, 50(slightly abnormal), 75% (markedly abnormal) of the nerve
