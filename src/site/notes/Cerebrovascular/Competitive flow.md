#cerebrovascular 

Competetive flow is a phenomenon when scrolling through an angiogram that contrast appears in an artery then disappears as you continue scrolling through the phases

Eg. if a patient has an Acomm, then on a frontal shot, you will see vessels appear on the opposite side of the falx then washout
	This washout is secondary to non-contrasted blood flowing through those arteries and thus washing out the contrast
