#cerebrovascular 

## Considerations
- proximal and distal control
- you can prep the neck to get the common carotid
- If the patient has [[Cerebrovascular/ICAD; intracranial atherosclerotic disease\|ICAD; intracranial atherosclerotic disease]] calcifications can complicate proximal control 

## Communicating segment aneurysms
- to get proximal control, you must secure the paraclinoid segment of the ICA
- **Clinoidectomy** is necessary to get extra space
	- attachments of the anterior clinoid process
		- lesser wing of the sphenoid
		- optic strut
		- roof of the optic canal
