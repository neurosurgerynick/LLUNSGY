#cerebrovascular 

Headache precipitated by exertion (ie my neck hurts when moving boxes) is extremely concerning even if the CT is negative

CT head blood degrades in the first 2-6 hours
	proceed with Lumbar puncture for high clinical suspicion
		LP shows xanthochromia due to RBC breakdown, elevated RBCs, elevated opening pressure 

85% of SAH is caused by ruptured aneurysms

- RIsk factors: women, connective tissue disorders

## presentation
"Worst headache of my life"
Agitated
Sentinel bleed 1-2 weeks prior
bilateral radicular leg pain from blood in the subarachnoid space of the lumbar spine

## Exam
Hunt and Hess scale - percentage survival

Majority of patients are HH Grade III, and you should place an [[EVD\|EVD]]

[[Delayed Cerebral Ischemia; DCI\|Delayed Cerebral Ischemia; DCI]] = Neurologic presentation
[[Vasospasm\|Vasospasm]] = angiographic narrowing
## Imaging
Perform Noncontrast CT head
	**Noncontrast CT scan of the head** is the initial diagnostic test of choice because it can be performed quickly and has high sensitivity for detecting blood pooling in the sulci or basal cisterns of the subarachnoid space.Â  If the CT scan is unremarkable and there is still reasonable suspicion for SAH, lumbar puncture is performed to evaluate for red blood cells or **xanthochromia** (yellow or pink discoloration of cerebrospinal fluid from hemoglobin degradation products).

Do DSA and another DSA 7 days later if negative

## Management
[[ULTRA trial\|ULTRA trial]] no change in outcome if you give TXA
Blood pressure 90-140 until aneurysm secured, then permissive HTN to prevent vasospasm
	[[Nimodipine\|Nimodipine]] for vasospasm 60mg q4h for 21 days
Stool softeners!
Monitor CVP, if <7 give NS bolus
Monitor for infectious problems, important to distinguish saccular and mycotic aneurysms
Monitor for extra-axial complications: takotsubos cardiomyopathy and neurogenic pulmonary edema, cerebral T waves
Montior for [[CSW; Cerebral salt wasting\|CSW; Cerebral salt wasting]]
Monitor for seizures, about 6% of patients present with seizures in the first 24 hours, can result in rebleeding
	Put all patients on Keppra for 7 days
	if a patient has a seizure, get another CT 
	Pathway for management of [[convulsive status epilepticus\|convulsive status epilepticus]]
Dexamethasone for nuchal rigidity

>flow diversion

If patients have a flow diverter they will need DAPT, not great for fresh bleeds


## DDx
[[herpes simplex virus encephalitis\|herpes simplex virus encephalitis]]: also presents with RBCs, but expect fever and neurologic deficits, which are not always present with a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which presents only with headache and neck stiffness
