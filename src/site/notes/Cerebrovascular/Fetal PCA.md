#cerebrovascular 

Anatomic variant
Defined by: **No P1 segment** 
To know for sure, you need to **shoot the posterior circulation**
	This will look like the patient is having a PCA stroke because the PCA is actually coming from the anterior circulation
The Communicating segment of the ICA leads directly into the PCA
No competitive flow, there is no "washout" from [[Cerebrovascular/Competitive flow\|Competitive flow]]
