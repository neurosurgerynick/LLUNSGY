# FAR LATERAL SUBOCCIPITAL APPROACH

case of foramen magnum meningioma
	encasement of basilar artery, VA, CN 9-12
70% of exposure around the medulla, if you drill down the condyle this allows access to the ventral aspect of the medulla
![Pasted image 20250910084059.png](/img/user/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250910084059.png)

## preoperative assessment
CTA or MRA to assess location of the vertebral artery
## special equipment
Cobra 3 ET tube
![Pasted image 20250910084235.png](/img/user/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250910084235.png)
Doppler for the vertebral artery located 1.2-1.5 cm from the midline
## Positioning
3/4 turned or just lateral, lateral is actually preferred as 3/4 sometimes the patients fall and end up prone
### Lateral

## incision
start in the midline with a hockey stick incision or a big C shape if you need access to the retrosigmoid region

stay in the avascular plane of the nuchae starting in the midline
## exposure
![Pasted image 20250910084418.png](/img/user/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250910084418.png)u

use the doppler and assess the location of the vertebral artery, dissecting medial to lateral as you are removing the arch of C1
stay at the bottom of the C1 arch with a penfield 1, you need to feel the bone underneath during your exposure no use for monopolar here because it can dive in
Use a matchstick drill to thin out C1 then kerrison to chip out the C1 lamina
Prepare the foramen magnum for the craniotomy by detaching the dura, craniotome at the inion and the asterion

## Retrocondylar approach (most frequent)
stay behind the condyle no need to get in there, however if there is a tumor in that area, you will need to go transcondylar
In the transcondylar approach you can expose up to 1/3 of the posterior aspect of the AO joint and be safe
This should be considered pre-operatively because you may need to perform an OC fusion if you take the condyle and destabilize the C1-condyle junction
4mm cutting drill with a penfield underneath, need to stabilize the hands, not allow the drill to be pushed down if someone were to push on your arms downward


## other variants
trans-jugular and trans-mastoid variants can be used to expose the posterior jugular bulb or presigmoid dura/mastoid segment of the facial nerve respectively


# Presurgical conference

69 year old with pituitary mass
Bitemporal field cuts, decreased visual acuity

## workup
For [[pituitary tumors\|pituitary tumors]]
CTA for vascular anatomy, very important to see the pericallossal arteries
CT can be used in a young patient to look for calcifications for craniopharyngeoma
MRI pituitary protocol
Testing for compression of the optic chiasm? 
[[Knosp classification\|Knosp classification]] how much encasement of the ICAs
[[optic coherence test\|optic coherence test]] the more thinning the less likely this patient will improve postoperatively
endocrinology - complete pituitary panel
TSH, prolactin level, IGF-1
prolactin level for a prolactin-secreting adenoma, greenberg mentions 200 as an arbitrary level
	medical management with cabergoline
The 20/30/50 rule
20% of patients are cured, 50% of patients are on lifelong meds, 30% require surgery
SATCHMO: adenoma, craniopharyngioma, hypothalamic, gliomas, lymphomas, optic nerve glioma, meningoma
## Approaches
pterional
subfrontal
transcortical transventricular

## surgery
insert a lumbar drain
ask anesthesia for stress dose steroids with hydrocortisone
thyroid
antibiotics
watch for DI during the case, ins and outs every hour
foley


## Repeat [[Spine/ACDF\|ACDF]]
default as a left handed surgeon is to go on the left, right on the right
if there is a scar on one side from a previous acdf, you want to go on the same side as previous 
you need ENT to scope them to ensure that they don't have a vocal cord paralysis - then go on the same side if they have an issue
after previous ACDF, did you have dysphagia? did you have coughing? hoarse voice? continued collection of saliva? Anything abnormal after your previous ACDF, likely their dysfunction will be permanent after the 2nd acdf
with posterior arthrodesis, the bulging of the PLL will disappear, anterior bulging discs will become flat over time

## synovial cyst L4-L5
64 year old male with L5 radiculopathy, causing pain in his big toe
MRI of the lumbar spine showing:
synovial cyst at L4-5
lateral recess stenosis, bilateral facet joint hypertrophy

### conservative approach
Initial surgery:
MIS tubular decompression: hemilaminotomy with medial facetecomy

### Arthrodesis
necessary if severe back pain with Modic changes
Instability seen on flex ex x-rays
Synovial cysts are an indicator of instability as is fluid in the facet joint
